imagine saying by the old gods in WoW and its just 3 giant tentacle monsters
by the many faced god
i like in game of thrones when they say shit like by the old gods by the old gods and the new by the drowned god
For 3 you.could do a "by the fates" idk maybe theres sets of gods for any given number?
I guess if you want to invoke exactly 12 gods you coyld say "by the olympians"
you can be specific or like by the gods but what if your level of awe is somewhere in the middle
Is there a practical way to invoke more than one god but not all of them

the assist
it took me a few tries to find the best spot to feed JoJo
yo  seconds is a long time
And it was just the one time you threw something into the trash across the room
getting your first pet in a new place is a good way of finding all the holes where ants come outta
It would probably be an innocuous step on an ant hill that killed hundreds
How would you feel if the reel was like 6 seconds
and seeing the day you killed the most bugs
imagine looking at your highlight reel after you died

My computer lagged

it's the spider's assist
Spider
if you kill a fly thats trapped in a web does the spider get an assist or do you

I'm imagining the gif but with Jorge now
Yall never team attacked a house centipede?
lol how could you even get an assist
what's your kda
most people have only ever killed buys
I couldnt find the Mulan gif fast enough
what do you think your kill count is rn

one
how many ants does it take to deliver a message
do you leave one to bring back a message
and im pretty evil about how i do it
Rats thrive in cities
i leave bugs alive unless theyre inconveniencing me but i really dont mind killing them
then*
this isn't a building part of nature to them
I think man made things are natural to animals especially considering they evolve taking them into account now
yeah
are bird nests natural
why would they be
wait did we resolve my question about whether manmade things are natural to animals

are we gods
does god cry when he steps on an ant
*an ant lmao
I think we were built different because I cried when I stepped on ant when I was eight
when the time comes to do battle i will be ready
i dont actually feel that bad but i just saw a spider and it was kinda just chillin so i left it
like you go to bed and you killed something today
It usually leads to me only killing mosquitoes
Idk I always weigh the pros and cons
ive started feeling a little moral dissonance lol
its kinda wild how often we kill bugs without a second thought
I suppose you should hopefully be a fan of your own IP
I definitely think you can make fan art of your own creation

Well what if its an established series though

Seems like a hard line to walk between due diligence as a friend and not imposing your morals on others
If someone spit in others people food I wouldn't have to be their friend but if it were something small then I'd have to be really close with them to tell them without coming across as controlling or nitpicky
Yeah I'd say so
Not in terms of whether you want to do it but whether it's socially reasonable
If your friend has a vice, is whether or not you say anything about it based on some weird equation factoring in how close you are and how severe the problem is

The arc is self absorption to communal responsibility.   Simba is young and arrogant but wants the glamor of being king. Lacks a fundamental understanding of the responsibility that comes with the job.  Mufasa and Scar represent two ways Simba could grow up to be like. Timon and Pumba become a third way which is still self absorbed but with less collateral damage than Scars way of living.   Simbas father, the king, is assassinated because he is king but while doing his duties as a father. Simba feels guilty and unworthy - to be loved or king.   He rejects the demands of that kind of responsibility and rejects  the past and his future - Hakunamatata   But then he grows up and begins to reevaluate his choices (scene of him moping looking up at the stars) just as he is presented with a new opportunity to do right (Nala finding him/explaining they thought he was dead)   Simba now sees Scar in a new light when he learns whats happened since he left. Decides to do the right thing and confront Scar.   Simba embodies his father (Rafikki saying, he lives in you/the others even briefly think he is Mufasa) and he saves pride rock and learns the truth from Scar.

Human Wu will avenge me after my demise by Wuhaters #hand
Allen set his own nickname to Human Wu's Father.

actually so could human wu
homo wu could be a chinese name
spawn
Or Homo Wu
I would have to spawn Human Wu
That wouldnt be as bad
What would I have to give you to bring a Fox Wu into this world
Thats worse than James II
James really named his son Fox
Does that mean Pigma is black
What if that's how he died
good thing james mccloud died before he could say the n word
And wolf just says the nword cause hes racist
So fox says the n word cause "my brother is black"
Falco is definitely black, but was adopted by a white conservative family
Rip
Is he no longer allowed to say bruh
Did he order his curry mild
Did he have a bar mitzvah in starfox zero
Did I miss something
Is falco no longer black
white
Are the space animals all the same ethnicity
I mean, bowser fits the CCP bill of oppressing free thought. But yeah other than that
Is Min Min the first implied Chinese character in smash
well maybe not the only point but still
like the fundamental point of names is to be distinct
I should have checked the chat for johns before saying that
no name of mine could get me to name my son john
like its just weird and silly
maybe its just me but even if im john the 4th im not naming my son john
John the first the second
because you could be using your father's name which also happens to be your own
well I suppose if it's already a chain it diminishes the conceitedness
even if it wasnt taboo it seems incredibly conceited lol
But that only makes me question the original name more
Like they're just referred to by their nickname or middle name
That seems to happen commonly enough when a parent and child have the same name
like its impractical when theres another one with that name in the same family
yeah ashkenaz say if the child happens to be named after a living relative, that name should not be the one usually referred by
But I feel like if your name was like John IV you would be under heavier pressure to keep it going
ignore the 22 that was a footnote
it just seems unnecessarily inconvenient
In Sephardic custom, naming children after living relatives (as well as deceased ones) is encouraged. This is considered an honor for the relative.22
ashkenaz and sephardi are completely at odds on the subject
actually whoa upon some research
the only reason I can imagine is some sense of passing down your legacy or w/e, but isn't that the point of your last name
youre not supposed to name someone after someone thats currently alive i think
like
its taboo in judaism
can someone explain the rationale behind naming your child after yourself
LOL thats so cool

where were you when i killed the brain expansion chat
Barry Tessler left the group.
Wait why did he leave. That was so ominous
I can't have this right now
Then we can count and prove the objective mathematical fact that America has the most
So do you happen to have a list of other countries atrocities that are as well documented?
Okay, I can go into specifically on each and every section, but as quick note a lot of these are one atrocity spread out and gone into specific cases or specific causes, extending the numbers. Not to mention that a lot of this is recent news due to recent covering and reporting since these topics are getting attention, and I am unaware if you have recent police brutality reports happening in China because I certainly have no way of accessing them. To add, a lot is coming from individual cases done by people who are American, which is more of a human atrocity than an American one and highlights issues with our culture and how that needs to change
Michael Dellapi left the group.
I ended up using both napkins

And there was some shit where a couple of dudes ran a train on some young girl
It was him im p sure
got her drunk and then had sex/tried to have sex with her? or was that another person
Keitaro got a child drunk or some shit i forgot
good thing leon stopped him at uhall
He committed a war crime on a bowser
yeah he abused his ex and threatened to murder his video editors
he was also accused of abuse and shit and then ignored it and posted a dk combo
also i didnt know keitaro was a criminal too
i cant keep track of all the criminals
wait false is a criminal??? i thought he was just dumb with the brawl doc
And keitaro uploaded it lol
False
wait who made this

allen im sending it to you so you can fwd whenever you need
the video is barely small enough to be sent over messenger

nah there's the big red boy  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_J._Carter
Intro courses are valuable yeah
in both countries
I'm sure there are _real_ communists
shes probably the most left official at that level of power cause i feel like if there was someone more, wed have heard about them and also stanned them
Being an intro course isnt bad and also no probably not the most left
intentionally
I am being a little provocative here
Is AoC our most left official? I like her but she's like the intro course to radicalize libs
https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md  Yes we can
i feel like other countries dont do the whole american intervention thing tho where they just go and kill ppl in random countries
and the left wing of the british labour party is quite a bit further left compared to aoc
Can you really say that we have committed the most? I feel that is a strong bias from both living here and American business being more public, also I would appreciate that you dont use redundant adjectives to try to make your point sound better
she was widely seen as being an ally to the leftist movement in britain
They absolutely do. They all want to kill each other. But they win because they know how to put their differences aside to organize and kill the people they think are ruining the world
I just brought this up because until her unfortunate comments
It's in the definition
Far right doesn't have infighting bc fascism embraces shaky alliances among conservatives
And she has always opposed the Blairite wing
The UK Labour party is run by austerity supporting BLAIRITES
that she is seen as being closer to Corbyn's wing (although not close to him personally)
Yeah basically all I meant to say was your point didn't need a slur in it and works better without it
i wonder if the far right has infighting lmao
No they're not they just had a fucking scandal about KICKING OUT A SOCIAL DEMOCRAT (JEZZA CORBYN) FOR BEING TOO FAR LEFT
I'm just saying a fact
Telling you not to say slurs isnt a reinforcement or rejection of leftist tradition, a thing that barely exists in the US, its a person interpersonally telling you not to say slurs because theyd appreciate if you didnt
Death to Israel unironically and fuck my cousins
And the british labour party is a real social democratic party for what it is worth
Lmao imagine
She's absolutely nowhere near the leftist fringe
JK Rowling supports Israel
I mean politically she's on the leftist fringe of the british labour party
Where am I
wait would be if what
What the fuck
jk rowling would be further left than aoc
WE HAVE FUCKING NOTHING BUILT IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE MORALLIZE ABOUT THE FUCKING CHINESE
i do feel like theres a decent amount of leftist infighting over things that are comparatively pretty small, like not wanting to work with leftists who are against bi/pan lesbians or something like that
WHAT FUCKING RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO SAY WHAT A LEFTIST NEEDS TO DO
WE HAVE NO LEFTIST TRADITION IN AMERICA
I dunno I think when humans have no rights it is every humans business
Who the fuck are we
None of your fucking business paul
Like leftist infighting has little to do with...slurs
I think it can be done
I think China can be the superpower to destroy America while also not cleansing brown people
I'm praising china as better because no country has committed more atrocities against more people than america and that's an objective mathematical fact
my brain got stuck on nier a2 and 2b tbh
2nd ammen- o ok
Second amend
wait jk
The left would be organized if I could say slurs without anyone saying anything about it is actually some garbage cmon
wait whats 2a
I used to be pretty anti 2A but now...iunno maaaaaang twould be nice
Yeah no, religious and ethnic cleansing of uighurs on claimed territory is incomparable to what the US is currently doing. Yeah the US is scummy and performing atrocities on immigrants but that doesnt absolve what other countries are doing as well. Its also very incentive that just because the group is Muslim you are less likely to believe global news since the US once lied about Muslims to start a war. Dont praise China as better just because they are doing atrocities on uighurs and not Central American immigrants
and i'm telling you you shouldn't give a flying fuck whether someone uses a naughty naughty bad boy word
I mean I'm not disagreeing when I tell you not to use a slur I'm telling you not to use a slur
forget trying to change this country, just wait for the end of the world
we're all going to die just enjoy yourself
I'm a sexy wittle baby but I kinda wanna be packing when the gestapo comes for me
none of it fucking matters
or whether you should be a vegan
or whether china bad
bc we all argue about whether it's ok or not for leftists to say slurs
This is unrelated but does anyone wanna buy guns and armor
we're all splintered bc we all fucking disagree about everything
chris has been typing for longer than strav I'm shook
there are no countrywide disciplined leftist organizations
idk how to build it either

just a bunch of sad angry americans eating hot chip
We have no leftist infrastructure
That's part of why america is such a fucked country
Random acts of individual violence won't do shit though
Its over
Paul you needed to forward that before the message

Barry were you online in DBGQ when someone posted a 8 parter Walter meme on how to make a pipe bomb



Wait before this conversation continues gonna need to cover my bases in case NWO comes up
And I'm sorry, whatever China's doing, China's rise to power is necessary to destroy america
Kill america first, everything else can fucking wait
The left needs to exercise TRIAGE
We are the biggest threat to human rights on the fucking planet and it's not even close
Especially when ours concerns another country
Again I think we can criticize both given human rights are not a purely domestic issue
https://uhrp.org/what-you-can-do  This is about what I could find, there was a brilliant IG post on the matter but I cant' find it, this will do for now
"Human rights violations abroad" are fucking meaningless to us until we get our own fucking country in order
There seemed to be a lot of discussion about morality, resources, history, and whatever else

The only way things are going to get better is if Americans prioritize the destruction of America above all else
D4C..
I got a b.good burger and I went to get a napkin and when I went back to the table I already had a napkin there
We're such a fucking cucked country
I think morality is hard to quantify, but immigration isn't.
We can just play Celeste eat hot chip and cry
Woah, I went out to lunch and there were so many posts.
No
can we address any violations lmao
I think this mentality kinda sucks like we can address human rights violations here and abroad
Greatest Satan and it's not even close.
Barry change your tone, you're scaring the leftist hoes
No, we are the Greatest Satan and greatest threat to life on earth ever. Shut the fuck up about some country across the world until we get our own shit in order
Or if we go to war with China, just fucking say "well BOTH SIDES are bad"
And what are Americans supposed to do about it? Support our country if we go to WW3 with china???
That's fine, but these people are being put in concentration camps
Don't say that word say any other word barry
I'll find it
No question
Best thing is boycott the brands who support them IMO but its a very exhaustive list
No matter what china is doing to the uighurs, they're better than fucking us
The problem is that anything you're told about "China Bad" is being told SPECIFICALLY to make you pull this retard BOTH SIDES shit
Genuine question not trynna flame u or somethin
Is there anything we can actually do to stop the holocausts happening in China and the southern border
This isnt CNN
Like I really dont know what else to say to these people being tortured
https://www.liveleak.com/view?t=sWGgg_1595200581
Barry stop attacking me for agreeing with you you pedantic piece of shit AsaCoco sniffer
It implies "fascism" something external to america
but it's a wrong quote
Yeah i know
I just try not to generalize because talking about China puts me on a tight rope
It's a quote
when fascism comes to america it will be holding a gc controller
No. America's been fascist since its inception
So don't just say "TRUMP SAID IT'S GOOD SO I'tS BADDDD"
When fascism comes to America it will be holding a Bible and wearing a cross
The reason why trump won is because he understands fundamental truths about america and what americans want. Fascism wins against liberalism because Fascism gets one thing right and uses that to go to moonlogic tradcath shit. Liberalism is just fucking lies. Lies and bullshit
Shotgun
even vietnam hates china and says they commit atrocities and they're the same government/political type
Cya in the unmarked van Barry
I would probably push him off
Again big distinction between China and their government
If trump told you not to jump off a bridge would you do it to spite him??? jesus fucking christ
At some point you have to accept that news media can create fear mongering towards China AND the Chinese government can be scum
If you need any confirmation, trump said it's the right thing to do
The first video I saw was from like swedish press lol
Yeah, it's also global capitalist media that's terrified of china
Yeah exactly
It's global media
Yeah I dont believe the news either but this is some shit that's not on news outlets lol
It's not just us media tho
I don't believe shit that our media says about the uighurs in china after we lied about wmds in iraq
Different browns same genocide
It's happening in China and at our border :(
honestly if i saw like a saw movie but with uyghurs in china, i'd believe it
For all its problems, it's the "good guy."
Like it's not some conspiracy theory
No, not even that. What you want is the "BOTH SIDES" argument for world politics.  China is unambiguously the "good guy" overall in world politics.
like their 1 party is called the communist party
Barry with all due respect I've found videos on IG showing some Muslims get tortured i don't think it's far-fetched to say that it's happening
they do have the cccp but yea
It's so late stage capitalist
And if someone calls China communist they're stupid
Rule of thumb is if someone criticizes China but doesn't criticize America for the exact same and more they're just racist lol
idk stats but my family says almost no one in vietnam works for an employer like they all just run super ratchet noodle and cell phone repair shops on the side of the dust road
Anytime you see a news article by one of our media conglomerates that tells you "CHINA BAD 1984 SURVEILLANCE STATE UIGHURS ANIMAL FARM BIG BROTHER" you should be extremely suspicious
Like they just did capitalism->socialism right
Vietnam seems like a great place to live
Pics of public sanitizer showers, egg cartons being handed out for free, etc
i'm fiending vietnam knowledge
They had pics and vids of their covid response faster than even leftist outlets
wait i need to see
Breadtube couple Emerican Johnson and Luna live in Vietnam and have a lot of good insights on the place
The difference is that the lying fake news corporate media believes in nothing and has a direct incentive for you to hate china.
Thank you tencent
ok highkey vietnam's political philosophy is kinda lit but also it might be vietcong propaganda
but again, i have no idea what's actually going on in china. but no one who claims to tell what's going on knows either
Hard to beat US and UK but Israel comes close
fuck if i know. i know that even if all the shit the lying fake news corporate media says about china is true, or even if china's government isn't really planning on "socialism by 2050," the country that has the best chance of building a decent future for humanity is china. but again it's not about an implicit merit of chinese people. it's because the material conditions of modern china are what marx believed to be the conditions under which socialist revolution can occur.
Just adding that
Israel is incredibly racist systemically and socially
Chinese construction workers in Japan are like Mexican construction workers here
IE Japan is great for Japanese and white people but not Chinese or Black people and will have a direct effect on job prospects
I think the greatest country in the world also depends on what ethnic group you belong to
who are like the top contenders
But there's no way around it: America is not the greatest country in the world. not by a long shot.  there probably is no "greatest country," but if there is, America is nowhere near that throne
Like I'm not trying to be doomer and blackpilled, I think things absolutely can get better
o yea def like #1 worst human event in all time lmao
The nazis based their holocaust on how we exterminated native americans
Fucking hate this place
Oh Im not defending America at all
Our body count is absolutely fucking enormous
but even then, is america not easily the most racist country in the world for not just chattel slavery, but literally genociding everyone who used to live on this continent?
I think it gets a little gray when goodness/morality refers to racism which can definitely affect quality of life for minorities
yea i guess there's a difference between like racism on a normal ppl level and racism from a government/institutional level
not to imply that other countries don't have problems of their own or that they don't have problems that don't come from us foreign policy
but like the point is "quality of life" =/= "goodness/morality"
or get in the prison pipeline
There's way more casual racism for sure
actually i guess it's arguable cause like they're more racist but like you also don't die to cops
or like not in the same way i guess
i mean i'm not saying the west is better than the places they destroyed, but like america is less racist than europe and imperialism isn't a factor there
I refuse to believe any of the countries that participated in colonialism/imperialism on the third world have a right to talk high and mighty about life in their countries
Well then I should say "the west" rather than america
But like, thats better than being shot by cops
i mean like what about europe tho like america didn't plunder europe and they're vastly more racist than america
I went to a hot spring and an older Japanese guy there consistently avoided sitting in the same tub as me, getting up as soon as I got in
except everything that doesn't have to do with resources is built on a basis of resources and material conditions. culture is not spontaneous. those countries would be way better places to live if america were not a cancer on the world
The big issues with the place are -Conservative gender and sexuality norms, though Ive been to plenty of drag shows there and its fine -Train groping -Racism towards Chinese people and sometimes other foreigners but its rarely more than cold glances
None of the people or institutions that participated in the lies about the wmds ever faced anything remotely approximating reconstruction or punishment btw. so don't give me any shit like "we changed since then." nothing fucking changed. the people who got us to fire depleted uranium shells at middle eastern civilians are crying crocodile tears and manufacturing lies to get us to be angry at china?? i don't believe shit
Also theres basically no crime
or at least @Fen Rui has adequately convinced me that america is pretty good from a non resources standpoint, as someone whos lived in asia, europe, and canada for pretty long times
So I spent the year getting medical procedures done because they were cheap and high quality before Id have to come back (teeth whitening, benign tumor removal, stocked up on contact lenses, etc)
It started with the healthcare for me I got bronchitis my first month, with no insurance paid $200 for approximately 50 pills and an inhaler, then once my job insurance activated I got most of it back
our media lied to us about wmds in iraq so we could slaughter muslims across the world for oil. i don't believe jack shit that they say about what other countries do to muslims
i mean like not from a resources standpoint, but from like an "america is probably bottom 5% racist countries" standpoint
I'd love to hear more about this since I'm pretty sheltered when it comes to this stuff
Yea that's where im at. America has brands that support Chinese concentration camps that torture Muslims so I guess of the two America is better, but wow I'd rather have better choices lol
Obviously Japan has a lot of issues and is hella colonial as well
Im also hesitant to praise quality of life in America when my depression basically evaporated in Japan
like yeah we have it good in this country... because we live on a mountain of corpses
I worked with folks from places like Kazakhstan in Japan and they assume America is this beautiful shining city
the problem is every good thing about living in america has nothing to do with the merit of its political and economic policies. it's because we plundered the rest of the world for their resources and labor
I think a lot of people immigrate to America because we have good branding
yea i feel like the country has plenty of problems but like other countries are even worse which is 
I am in no position to be anything short of grateful for the opportunities this country has offered me and my family but compliance is how we degrade
I agree that America is far better than most people of my social standing would give credit for but I also agree with the backlash the country receives. Specifically because most of the population knows this country more for its prosperity decades ago and probably thinks the left is complaining about nitpicks rather than systemic issues
I don't think per capita is a good measurement
and save for some Arab states importing slave labour, Luxembourg is the greatest country in the world
I suppose there's also migration per capita
More people immigrate to America
can u elaborate
Hot take: America is the greatest country in the world.
convergence
nvm it got delayed due to covid lol
and it gets way worse than that
If you want to wonder just how far this goes
https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/asia/china-mens-earrings-blurred-intl/index.html
this reminded me of a figurine I need to buy
It is beyond compare
I cannot understate just how many civil liberties are being compromised in China
There is a _world_ of difference between the US and China.
compromises our personal liberties to consume funko pops and corn slurry
also it's sad that america already compromises our personal liberties to do     nothing
Best to neglect education and do nothing to aid social mobility
Of course but for the sake of keeping the average American complacent
and not like normal ppl
or prisoners
but american rich ppl use chinese wage slaves anyways
There's nothing rich people want more than wage slaves with no time, intelligence, or motivation to achieve anything greater
I mean it makes sense that America is dumb as bricks right


Lol
hmm yea we forged the numbers a pretty ridiculous amount
Oh for sure
during the first wave we chalked up so many covid deaths to "heart attacks"
i don't doubt that they fudge the numbers but we do just as much
Their response is better for sure but its china
the same culture could exist in america if our idea of "leftism" was based on demanding the basic necessities of life as a human right rather than "uhhh rename master bedrooms to something else"
Id think twice before believing the china graph lol
Like this kind of culture grows on the basis of a government that's willing to exert authority over the economy, not the other way around
part of the american brain worm is that we put way more stake in "culture"/"culture war" shit than it's actually worth
idk if it's necessarily a "cultural" thing, it's a political/economic architecture thing, and that doesn't grow from culture that grows from revolutionary political movements
We ought not to have both at the same time lol
The U.S. is the culmination of shitty education and an emphasis on the rights of the individual
That's what I wish we could have
so it's not surprising their numbers are lower
I am jealous of a culture that...is willing to forego small personal liberties to ensure the safety of their population
like it or not their country can handle a pandemic infinitely better than ours
yeah not without its drawbacks but none of the drawbacks have to do with their pandemic numbers
There's a lot more surveillance there
Well China is better in those aspects and it's not without it's drawbacks
people are legitimately just triggered that we're being made fools of so shriek that they have to be lying or covering up when they're really just a better functioning country
Goes from a million cases to like 0 in a day
China's covid graph is ridiculous
china is a country that was actually able to manufacture masks when they were needed, deliver food and resources to people living at home, etc etc. you know, like respond to the pandemic
Cuz thats what my friends mom said like Im not anti vaccine but isnt this a little fast what if its dangerous? And my dad was like what do you think theyre putting in this
i'm gonna be real, i buy it
therefore vietnam is covering up covid deaths cause communism is evil
like are we really buying that china had 80k covid cases and 4k deaths
yeyeye i get what you're saying
The Future
He was like theyre not gonna put out some vaccine that they have no idea if itll work or not, these things are highly highly tested
Which is what my dad said
But there are frameworks to build off of
If the disease made you grow another toe Id be more wary
Covid is a derivative of coronavirus which means that its not <an unknown new thing> there are baseline understandings of coronaviruses
i'm just imagining baku going to the clinic and is like  "lemme get the vaccine with no covid, no autism, no gluten"  "sir we can't take shit out the vaccine"
my dad always says vietnam having no covid deaths is vietcong propaganda
Cuz heres my thing
And my dad I think was 2 seconds away from flipping it looked like
My friends mom said she doesnt trust the vaccine to my dad
What are they putting in the vaccine has been coming up in a lot of circles lately? To people that have been pretty smart about the situation prior
If not to run counter to people propping up kinda weird anti-vax arguments
I think I lean towards more optimistic on most days
Im optimistic or pessimistic depending on the day
Ive been thinking about the vaccine a lot
ohp
But bad coincidence
Obviously wont be as bad
I looked up Vietnam out of curiosity and theyre getting hit with a wave as of 15 hours ago :(
And it's been said, but it's incredibly ironic that the Trump campaign ran on the idea of not allowing immigration and his first (maybe only) term is ending on Americans not being able to go to other countries because we're plague-ridden bilge rats from our garbage government's reaction to covid
Well with a caveat. It's gonna be interesting to America because we botched it so hard. The rest of the world is going back to normal around now cuz they didn't botch their response. Like in Vietnam where I don't think anyone's died of covid it's probably gonna be nowhere near as interesting in hindsight as it is to us who absolutely just basically manslaughtered thousands of people
I was thinking covid is probably not that interesting as a whole since living through it hasn't felt too eventful, but that's short sighted
Oh it's absolutely going to be an interesting story in hindsight
Even though it's a problematic trope, I think it's fair to say that the war torn veteran is a cooler character than the overworked doctor
The prominence of covid related plots will probably depend on how interesting the story becomes in hindsight and what can be made out of it
Yup
But were in the middle of an event so disruptive that itll just be implicit context in real life and stories
Its weird realizing that future movies set in the real world will necessarily be taking place specifically after or during COVID, even if theres nothing really different between this and like world wars happening
So in fiction, history aligns with the real world unless otherwise specified, right

Agreed on this
It should be more feasible to convey conflicting ideas in a neutral manner
Just another reason why we need to move to teleological language like the aliens in Arrival
I think it's unfortunate that when you want to say something with a caveat, you have to be careful with the ordering because it influences how your statement is interpreted so strongly in one direction
That sounds hype af how do we play

What is this

everything from this group makes me think of this chat

I forgot my mixer password so I gave up
What cord is this in

It's like... an ai that gives you a text-based adventure novel game thing???
I don't know exactly how to explain aidungeon myself
You'll know in 3 loops
Or only nonloopers
Is this something only loopers know
OMG ALLEN
What is aidungeon
on Mixer?
Mixer?
I'll stream it
THE PRODIGAL SON
Like it works a lot better now
Apparently it got a really big update recently
OMG LEON
I want to feed this chat into aidungeon and see what happens
Allen you're a fucking genius
If you woke up tomorrow and your dad was like allen it's July 22nd and you were like what yeah, how could he kill you
Well theyre all better than you
How
How or why
How could they
Theyd probably kill you
Yeah I guess everyone else is just ancient and insane
So everyone around you is just always better than you
What if every day was a time loop for everyone except you were the only person moving through time
https://youtu.be/L5y3P5F_B5A
That sounds like westworld
Everyone experiences the same basketball game over and over and gradually achieve self-awareness
Imagine if you just got wr in like every speedrun on the same day
That's the SCP I shared
ye something like that
What if there was a story where everyone experienced the groundhog day
The mc realizes that any day can make a difference
And that's the end of the story
And I can't think of one off the top of my head
I think it'd have to be a day where I could make a tremendous difference in my life or someone elses life
Can you force a reset by killing yourself
Yeah you gotta give yourself a goal or task
Id try to write a romcom based on my experiences in the hopes that even if I cant ever interact with the results of it it might become a classic movie in a divergent timeline
Would you try to figure out how to make a particular person fall in love with you like bill Murray
What would you try to do first if you were stuck in the loop


Not sure tbh. I do wanna mention one of my favorite Groundhog Day type things is an SCP thing  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1733
But also if youre repeating a day you love, how long could you sustain it before you cant stand it anymore
I guess if youre truly stuck forever it doesnt matter how much buffer you try to put between yourself and repetition
But at the same time
But if you were looping in NY you could actually do an absurd amount of things throughout one day
Palm Springs and Groundhog Day were both in pretty isolated locations
End of Cunkleon was also really good
You know actually
Imagine the increasingly unhinged eulogies you can deliver
That was a good day though
Yeah Id watch paul die for eternity
it was such a pleasant time
mainly bc none are that good, but tbh paul's funeral
fuck man that's so tough...

The current one
If you got trapped in a time loop forever what day of your life so far would you want it to be
I remember in Rocket Power the kids made a zine

I only mentally said it
i'm so shook some ppl were out here saying zigns lmao
i cant believe you would put yaseen in such a precarious predicament
People organize a bunch of art based around a specific theme and then put it together
80% of the zines I've encountered are FE lol
The FE one Allen linked takes the compilation of different art approach
Here are some that shes made in response to covid


https://twitter.com/FE_academy_zine
I only know what they are bc gf makes a ton
Its like a handmade magazine relative to political or artistic movements
Whats a zine
Now that I know that's a pretty messed up situation to be put in
In my defense I didn't know what a zine was lol
I'm upset
Im basing my answer partially off the lyrics of Flagpole Sitta
But I think they're kind of their own thing?
I wanna publish 'zines And rage against machines I wanna pierce my tongue It doesn't hurt, it feels fine The trivial sublime I'd like to turn off time And kill my mind You kill my mind, mind
I knew it was a derivative of magazines
Its an abbreviation of magazines I thought
Its zeens
this is terrible

Zeens
oh no
that's what I always assumed, but I just realized it could be zeens
I think it has to be zigns
are zines "zigns" or "zeens"

they're onto me
iirc canonically superman hunches over and acts kinda antisocial as clark kent
His disguise is more his act than his appearance
Takes off glasses
Superman
like the totally epic battle simulator youtube ads
and then the wolverines win
but there were 2 batmans
there's 2 batmans and 999 wolverines
nah there's like rows and rows of wolverines
weren't there like 2
there's like 5 million batmans or wolverines or something and then the movie ends
the most disguised he can be is covering no face
What about Batman
wait what exactly was the end of the prestige again lol
what if justin trudeau has always been black all along
youre covering your entire face
its max
the facial covering is low
where is the bell
so it would still just be a linear line
that still counts as a full disguise with probably max effort
lol imagine how much you could confuse the world by shapeshifting into mystique or any shapeshifter
wait no its not lol
that's a good example for my bell curve theory
what if it's like the prestige where the entire rest of your life is the disguise
what if you transformed into yourself but intentionally let someone see the end of the process, making them believe you might be anyone but yourself
if youre a transformer and people know what you transform into them maybe not lol
is transforming covering your face
like a mask or a lloyd forger disguise
so the last one is different from ski mask in that it can mean fully covering your face in any way
Damn those gen ys
Wait there are millennials in the chat
Damn millennials
Its going to sound appropriate when millennials are the old generation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut_hand

which one of these is a better disguise
Apparently the makeup that juggalos (fans of insane clown posse) wear fucks up facial recognition software really well
because if you try hard enough you can disguise yourself in a way that isn't clearly suspicious
Good question
my reasoning was that if you just wear a ski mask that does a good job of hiding your identity but there's a higher tier of disguise where you potentially don't even need to cover your face

Okay but which one of these is a better disguise though
@Allen Wu

would a graph of how hard you try on a disguise vs. how much of your face is covered follow a bell curve

Of course it had to be the three who are afraid of each other
rochambeau made me think it came from france
wow the west got it from japan
whoa

Understandable
Rock Paper Scissors is chinese
Purple coins arent
yea i guess
are coins earth
he controls all the elements
he has the mustang glove
is mario an alchemist
Even though I compared it to Hand of Midas lmao
Well it's not an equivalent exchange
it shouldn't take that many of these coins to exceed ness's body mass

well coins can also fly out of your body though
it's definitely some smaller thing cause u can lose over 100%
Wait so % is like % of mass you lost?
there's no loss of mass though unless that's the reason fighters get launched further by subsequent impacts
@Allen Wu
my answer
i think mario can just convert percent into cents
Allen
so are coins just in every fighter
cause they dont appear otherwise
the coins come from the thing mario is jumping into
wait I didn't get a satisfactory answer to my coin question
yeah you right
ohhhh
like in the mario lore apparently
but it can also go under a certain threshold where it's so cartoony that it's okay
well I basically meant that a story needs a certain threshold of maturity in order to be able to include genocide
well genocide is only sentient beens
probably some fish
who did elsa kill
because I'm hitler and elsa
wait i really wanna know why you were thinking about genocide
Yet still, somehow, the best of the sequels
And its trash
9 is romantic subplot + OH SHIT THE END OF THE WORLD + Bullshit force shit
Because protagonist plans need to not work out sometimes so we can better appreciate the vast majority of the time when they actually do
All I know about episode 9 is that there's a romantic subplot between Rey and Kylo and there's a meme about "THEY FLY NOW"
Well I guess Im not really well informed on the complaints and I dont wanna look into it but I think its silly that people are mad about the casino stuff specifically not mattering
the entire movie was just padding for that lightspeed crash
And none of it mattered in 9
albeit kinda cool things
the last jedi was just a lot of random things happening
And similar premise of "subverting the genre they're in"
Same director
I appreciated the casino plot
Connection?
Ill say it
I'm interested in TLJ if only because I loved Knives Out
Tbh ive tried to forget TLJ
The criticism is that that scene was like 1/4 of the movie
I mean I heard there was a weird out of place scene in episode 8 where rose and someone go to a casino and they basically have a "look at camera and tell you about the ramifications of what goes in the movies" moment
Yeah but they had middle school best friends older brother vibrations
Which is why they were bad lol
They didn't
what made you say this
I mean I suppose real life is in the middle
idk I only saw episode 7 so i don't have an opinion
I heard criticisms the Star Wars sequel trilogy tried to deal with the ramifications of Star Wars stuff but it failed to so in a compelling way
what about nuking hiroshima
Im trying to think, but its hard because its necessarily a negative example
Ok but what's in the middle
Where like the ramifications arent really grappled with
I think Star Wars genocide is on the kid side of the division
or alderaan
is destroying the death star middle range
Actually wait can you give me an example of something in that middle range?
Isnt it interesting that you can put straight genocide in mature stories or kid stories but theres a middle range where it is too dark
Thats pretty messed up
"One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horse-hair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin."  page 4 of the super mario bros instruction manual
What I said
Wait "that" as in what I said or what you previously said
I think the strongest evidence toward that is from Mario maker which is of dubious canonicity
Yeah but iirc canonically the blocks are all formerly people/toads transformed by the Koopa Army into blocks
Well thats what you would think but even for the blocks can we be sure the coins were actually in the block
well the move comes from how he jumps below blocks to get the coins out of the block
Both. He uses a Hand of Midas-esque ability to turn parts of your body into coins

Is this related to 2020
When you get up bd by Mario do coins get ejected from your body or does Mario generate them from contact with you
Probably some langueGe out there
I thought you guys could tell when I was vocally capitalizing
"If"?
what if you could vocally capitalize

Im trying to shatter my fingers learning flight cancel combos so thats where my lifes meaning is at
ye
That was Robert Yangs talk iirc
https://www.quora.com/Was-Nietzsche-rooted-in-pessimism-or-optimism  this thing i found on the internet kinda gets at why some people find him optimistic
Like idr the details but I was at this talk by a game designer at magnet who was like "Nietzsche was kind of optimistic in some way??"
I always thought it was like nihilism: life has no meaning :( existentialism: life has no meaning :l and neo-existentialism life has no meaning :)
he really do be vibing
its just like "vibe"
taoism is great
Eh I heard the sadface isn't necessarily implied in Nietzche's works
Nihilism is like "life has no meaning :(" and existentialism is like "life has no meaning :)"

Yeah or 15 year olds in high school philosophy club
I was thinking of the sign from They Live that's just saying "Marry and Reproduce"
At least not with books
But at some point I realized a sheltered 20 something year old has no business trying to figure out life lol
Stoicism is like the optimal one, who wants to do the optimal thing ever
I used to be super into philosophy and I still think surface level reading and grasping at how to apply it is fun
Its definitely like be happy you are a peasant and your father beats you
also where's my philosophy taoism
Yeah I saw that and was like sure.... normal
Stoicism honestly seems like a pretty solid mindset
confucianism is definitely not "live a normal life" lmao
i learned about stoicism in a class i took about death and dying and stuff
Haha yeah...... what a fool that would be ...
the thing is there's a lot of overlap between different philosophies
What a nerd
Imagine seeing all of these and picking stoicism
Free yourself from pain wuuuuuh

But what do i know

Anything bigger than a fruit fly
it's a metroid
Like a horse fly or a fruit fly
But if its like a tiny nat Im going fishing with a spoon
Like if its a fly Im throwing it out
What's the thresh
Lets add that to our regression table
To me it depends how big the bug is

Pineapple juice
Lemon juice
also what juice would have higher or lower thresholds
in which case throwing out 40% of it would feel wasteful
Well you could have like a keg of juice
Thats directly proportionate
does the % remaining matter or the volume
Yeah 30-40% seems right
it's orange juice
Depends on the type of juice
40%
what's the threshold
Remove and drink
most of it
How much of the juice is left
should you just pour it out, try to remove it but still drink it, or just consume it
what's the correct amount to care if a bug lands in your juice
A species of crab

oh it was 4 days ago

Infinite jumps but one airdodge 
Exactly
This guy g&w takes flight every 2 seconds he would never touch the ground with infinite jumps
On initial thinking I think the character that gets a ton from infinite jumps are wario and g&w
Walk ups
And play it like how you would play a stage with no ledges but vertical
Yeah thats what I first thought
You could camp at the top
I feel that has more or less existed in actual smash and just gets banned
I think the immediate consideration is camping under the stage but like
Anyone with infinite jumps can camp forever under the stage so they're all good but if everyone had infinite jumps then the tier list would probably be very similar
Yeah that's the y axis
I thought of it with one of the axes being character power level
Is this similar to how you imagine it looking

Is Ganon with infinite jumps is worse than regular Palu
Well dont they get naturally sorted by how good they are
Yeah but are we sorting them
Were graphing how good every character is with X jumps
Or css order
Or by improvement
Are we sorting them on the graph by how good they are
I guess every character has some sort of upper bound on how good they would be with an infinite number of jumps
Assuming for a baseline youre taking a character with just 2 jumps regularly
If you graphed number of additional jumps to give a character vs how much better they would become, what would the graph look like

Fuck
There we go
Owned
Justin Ha
I literally deleted the autocorrect
I didnt mean to do that
Wait
Im pretty sure it was Justin Haha
Maybe it was Justin
Dorohedoro I feel has handled "power level differences" better than anything else I've ever consumed
Maybe I said it about JoJo or Dorohedoro
I feel like that's something you would say about mha but not me
Maybe I said it facetiously?
I don't believe I've ever thought that
I remember you saying you liked that some people got pineapple head-mode iirc
Or maybe Im misunderstanding the nuance
Idk if it was you or someone else that mentioned that that was part of what you liked about mha
you're just doing a regular superhero story with more bullshit steps
Like what's the point of "everyone has a superpower" if you just give some people godmode and others garbage in the first place
Or rather, I don't think Quirks like One For All should exist if other people have pineapple-heads as their Quirk
I just don't like One For All as a concept
I think he didn't necessarily deserve it at first, but he's kinda "earning it" little by little as he goes along
Still dont think deku deserves one for all
he looks cooler in b&w/the manga lmao
the best parts of mha are up there with the best parts of anything imo
o wait ive never seen overhaul in color before
if only all americans agreed
I love his plan for world domination
I love that he's a neat freak
Plague Masks in general are top tier

and hes fma
overhaul looks cool too
or I guess it would look like that to everyone replying to him
I can't believe how dirty he was did
okay I guess it's just me but when I reply to barry the medal gets left hanging lol
Overhaul slaps as a villain so much
without animation*
i haven't read the manga but i feel like i'd enjoy the manga even less without anime
and the rest was like this is ok
i mean like i personally am not that big a fan of mha but that arc was like wow this is good
yooo this is exactly why i'm scared of people looking for like, genetic predisposition to being a gender or sexual minority. like if people find a way to keep their kid from being gay than people are going to eugenics gay people in a sense
this part of mha almost makes the anime worth watching
I wanna check something
can someone reply to one of barry's messages
mood
Well a lot period haha
I dont doubt it gets better I just got a lotta shows on my plate
Yeah ironically enough my friend was talking to me about MHA today/where I fell off
There's some genuinely good moments
I genuinely think you should watch season 3 and the first half of season 4 of mha even though it's not as good as jojo or hxh or dr. stone @Michael Dellapi
Bro that's a thing in mha too
Big sacrificial lamb guy
He seems to suck in all of them
I have yet to find a storyline i like Professor X in
TRUE
Which in the scope of the X-men universe is TrueBlue
Charles goes down the route of if the choice exists someone might make the choice for us
For sure
"If you could choose to be normal or maintain your differences what would you choose" is always so interesting to me
Classic
Ultimately Xavier had the X-Men infiltrate the lab and kill everyone involved
Good storyline in general imo
It was interesting to me
Theres an x men arc about a person that makes a drug that gets rid of your mutagen
It hit me hard when he said he was almost one of the X-men
Thats so fucking sad what the
Its okay death is never permanent in marvel unless you are uncle Ben
https://imgur.com/gallery/I71V6
And if its a group of villains invading the mansion i could see it
Ruthless not that i know of  Marvel isnt my specialty but if im not mistaken hes very much not above killing people
I remember reading about when Wolverine had to kill some random kid whose mutant power was just killing people
Is wolverine known for ruthless killing?
Yeah i wouldnt put it past him
Okay but like if they were all villains would wolverine really slaughter them all
im getting confused
my bad
yeah its mysterio
Wolverine then recounts to Hawkeye the tale about how a group of super villains, many of whom were already dead, seemingly invade the X-Mansion. Wolverine begins to evacuate the younger students while the rest of the X-Men had mysteriously vanished since the onslaught began. Finally the fight comes down to Wolverine and Bullseye. After finally killing him off, Bullseye is revealed to be Jubilee. Mysterio then appears, and the illusion is swept away, revealing Wolverine has slaughtered the X-Men.
House of Mysterio
Ah yes
No its mysterio
Thats a very wanda thing to do tbh
if not im a liar
i could be misremembering but im 99.9% sure its wanda
Thats fucking mad
YO SHE DOES WHAT
and wolverine straight up kills them all with like almost no resistance cuz everyone was trying to like stop wolverine
wanda brainwashes wolverine to see every member of the institute as a villain (sabretooth, magneto etc)
its even worse
(what Logan was based on)
oh in old man logan
Wanda dead ass said "fuck this entire species"
I think the movies are dramatically less convoluted than the comics, but even that's a mess of time travel and entire movies that got retconned in-universe
reading old man logan reminded me how fucked a house of m movie would be
house of m is so fucked
which makes things complicated because every writer establishes their own continuity <except when its for that>
Bro i want marvel to make a House of M movie so bad
cuz thats in every comic
like the mutant genocide
its also absolutely essential to know key certain events
the x-men lore is honestly up there with James Joyce's Ulysses in defying comprehension

Moira is a really cool character but also x men is almost impenetrable
During the Chaos War, Moira MacTaggart, Thunderbird, Banshee, Esme and Sophie of the Stepford Cuckoos, and Multiple Man's fallen clones are resurrected and appear on the former grounds of the X-Men school. There, Moira MacTaggart finds one of Destiny's diaries which contains a passage depicting the events of the war and apparently the key to defeating Amatsu-Mikaboshi. It is also revealed that she is the same Irene Adler of Sherlock Holmes's stories.[24] After Thunderbird prayed to the Thunderbird God to teleport the group away from the attacking Carrion Crow, Thunderbird and the group learned that Moira has been possessed by Destiny's ghost.[25]
In 1946, a Dr. Nathan Milbury (apparently Mister Sinister in disguise) was involved with Project: Black Womb, a secret government project headed by Amanda Mueller and aided by Alexander Ryking (father of Carter Ryking), Brian Xavier (Professor X's father), Kurt Marko (father of Juggernaut), and Irene Adler[citation needed].
imo @Allen Wu i dont think it would be a new positive case
I love how absurd any attempts to summarize comics are
thats a good point. someone tried asking my dad about the blood type thing and he was like i truly could not tell you

while investigating this I found out that Mystique had a lover named Irene Adler
if someone shapeshifted into an exact copy of someone with COVID, would that count as a new positive case
okay this is more out there but
I wonder what the world record for getting covid symptoms is
I though the consensus was that no one knows how or why it works
i can ask my dad tonight honestly im curious
i think symptoms are dependent on white blood cell count and activity no?
ohhh
Or what property of the incubation process caps it at around 14 days
The reason I wondered is because we accept that it takes 2-14 days for covid symptoms to appear but I dont know what causes that time range
I feel like blood type would be one of the first factors
I think the range of severity is more intuitive than the range in time to symptoms though
studies are showing that its possible that even blood type may be a determinant in severity
@Allen Wu even if you put people in the same environmental situation the biological response would be different
I think this idea and the exceptions to it are fascinating though
But they would both be wrong
They wouldnt try to plug the usb in the same way
but i do believe that if you take two identical people and have them experience the exact same things there's almost 100% guarantee they'll do the same things and make the same decisions
it's a crapshoot
depends on how much is the minimum their experiences diverge
Or does the virus immediately throw it off by having an inconsistent process
Assuming they minimize how much their experiences diverge would they pretty much experience symptoms (like coughing) in synch?
So imagine if you infect two identical people at the same time
Also, if you never show symptoms did you make it to the other cliff through sheer ignorance
it depends on the virus and the people
Well is the variance from when you realize you ran off the cliff or when the virus stops procrastinating
It's like that looney toons thing where you run off a cliff
Im not a doctor but Id assume its how long it takes your body to notice something wrong
What causes the variation between people
What determines how long it takes an individual to show symptoms of a virus

i feel like it used to be bad and then it became good
god this meme is so good

I think it has more to do with the unpredictability of image sizes
I guess your likelihood to be satisfied by the first few results is much higher than for your first few image results but is that a good reason to not show more results
why are google results split into pages for regular searches but not pictures

I think relevance in the meta now and relevance in the future meta are both good talking points but you gotta keep it consistent
lol I think we can understand what he wanted to convey, even if he ended up saying this character is good but worse than you think, but might get better
it wasn't like... the lifestyle guru character from Knives Out ratio of words said to information conveyed
tbh i was expecting to get less information out of this than i did. it's just that the way top players describe characters is often so vague
Has info even
I'm getting angry

So
*um
Im

Fuckit I'm posting it again
Do I need to copypaste it again
The year before covid, the year of covid and the year of covid after all hope was lost
Are you guys gonna make me get the lenin quote again
This year has been at least 3 years so far

Thats wild

That's strike 2 fen
uwu
lost to the nap
I don't know what the original intention
Well either way what did you mean to say
It's probably a typo

>.>
just woke up from nap
I literally don't remember
what an 'an' is lost to time
i don't remember
You cannot be allowed to know
Now Fen absolutely cannot tell you
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT AN IS
It's the fee for not explaining what an is
wait why
*sad*
evil country
I got a bill for $30,260.35 today =|
ugh
Distracted
I played some of it but uh
compared to SC of Westminster countries
like so absurdly powerful
the SCOTUS is like _extremely_ powerful
Kangaroos go roo
She's a ghoul and I despise how establishment Dems lionize her
Oh absolutely gun down RBG. She could've stepped down voluntarily the second Obama won in 2012 but the idiot decided to stay for no good reason
We should fill the SC with kangaroos
They should also get RBG while they're at it
Michael have you played Control? I've heard that game described as "a game where you play as an SCP agent"
Yeah basically
SCP stands for Secure Containment Protocol/Secure Contain Protect, which is like this communal work of fiction on the internet about an illuminati-esque organization that is responsible for containing "anomalous" lifeforms/materials/objects. each SCP article describes the containment protocols for some freakish supernatural horror  @Michael Dellapi
as far as I can tell it's like if Men in Black were real but still fake
I'm not alone
LEMME TELL YOU MICHAEL
Ive never had the courage to ask
Wait whats SCP
Biden would literally appoint conservatives is one of the other reasons why voting for Biden to "save" the SC is bullshit
we have the cod players to do it
we need to assassinate several republican supreme court justices and then also elect biden
Trust me it could've been either
(not to imply fdr was radical)
I wasn't sure if this long response would be to women's rights or pawg
but on the topic of the supreme court, this kinda of decision is one of the reasons why "You need to vote for Biden! The Supreme Court hangs in the balance!" is bullshit  like the supreme court is firmly in the conservative ring and the only way to take it back is by electing a president radical enough to do something insanely controversial to fix it like how FDR packed the courts
no asian knows about pawg
i bet paul that a mutual friend who is asian didn't know what pawg was and he lost and had to play the runeterra tutorial
secure cp across ssh
O
my college professor

What's that
I also know the linux scp
everyone should know about it
the SCP project rules
I can't believe scp was known
I know what is scp but not pawg
i thought scp was like winscp
apparently everyone knows what pawg and scp mean
Cant believe I missed the pawg discourse
Wrt this
Wait whats an an
Either way extremely cringe decision
expansive question
Well they don't have to worry about actually experiencing the results of this decision so is it really their rights?
damn imagine voting against ur own rights 
kagan and breyer joined the conservative majority
yeah I was supposed to line up commentary on this case but I didn't do it yet
this was held supreme court 7-2
employers who buy insurance can force insurance to not cover this
it goes further than that
wait what's an
insurance is no longer required to cover contraceptive care
I guess we should have an to all women
this is definitely 100% true. it's an air-tight testimony
Probably top 3 most valuable tags
Being pawg is white privilege
Barry I found out about that tag when I was like 14 im with u
This is probably truer than I'd like to admit
@Thao Nguyentold me to say that knowing about pawg is white privilege
Pog is already the meme version
i feel like it was one of the first tags i saw on pornhub when i started masturbating as a teen
i don't know about gawp but i've known pawg for like at least 10 years
i don't watch enough porn
i've never seen it before either lmao
i thought it was a meme version of pog lmao
wtf who knows about gawp
Ive never seen this acronym before
gohp
HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW THIS
Gohp
IS THIS NEW INFORMATION THAO!?!?
WHAT

Whenever someone gets the distinction between acronym and initialism correct my pee pee tingles
lets go google

sorry anagram*
i feel like some wires in my brain are crossed because i can't read this without recognizing it as an acronym of pawg
it's both more straightforwards and makes them sound stupid
gawk
i never know whether to say the letters or gawp cause like it's such a pronounceable acronym
credit to @Thao Nguyen for this brilliant idea
we should call the gop the gawp party
If you ever find yourself in the middle of a circular lake with monster who can run less than 4.6033388489 times as fast as you can row, then row outwards and around on a semi-circular path of radius R/2K until you reach a radius of R/K, then continue straight on until you reach the shore, and escape. The path you will follow will resemble a letter 'J'.

plus just the word "full" is talking about volume and not height
or else there'd be no end of unreasonable glass shapes you could propose that are half full by height
I think it must be volume
they said dead reckoning
is it half full if its half full by volume or by height
wait the glass half full one

idk where to say this but 2020 might have 2 we didn't start the fire verses at this point
the one called final is less likely to be the most recent one
i feel like they're both bad and i'd just look at the timestamp at that point
Final is used for documentation for what was formally used while updated could be corrections that couldnt make it for the final but was not used at the time, more informal
Yeah what was the last final thing that was updated
Or the final one was updated
A time when the updated one was final
What was the last thing you saw labeled final that wasn't the final version?
Final or Updated
Which version of a document is the most recent one
Like I feel no need to be "productive" when I play AC
I enjoy games like Animal Crossing for the opposite reason. Like I lack the stress of like, wanting to get better at the game, I just fuck around and harass villagers and fish
Where a lot of the time, when you're gaming, you feel guilt about not being productive, so Animal Crossing-type games have appeal because they give you a sense of productivity within your gaming
it could be related to a realization I had from playing stardew valley
Maybe the knowledge of how much you "suffered" for the satisfaction makes it feel "exclusive" and "special"
Maybe gamers are just gluttons for punishment
Its not necessarily a pvp thing since there are also single player games where a lot of their appeal/selling point is frustration
Are the lows necessary to experience the highs or do we just become irrationally dependent on frustrating games
But its interesting how common it is to prefer games where you feel angry/upset half the time over single player / co-op games where a much larger portion of your experience is positive
Like, I get it and playing/improving in smash feels really meaningful
I wonder how the appeal of pvp games works and why it exists on a psychological level
Youre always messing something up
But yeah theres no positive attribution to blanking around
Ive made the necessary augmentations
I used to love the clown lifestyle but now its almost exclusively negative
But youre right
I changed my twitter name to Michael (Clown)
But clowning is almost always attached to around
It makes sense because all these phrases pretty much convey not making progress
pottering
fucking around? messing around?

what else is done around
clown has gotten a way more negative connotation recently
what's so circular about clowning
i feel like clowning has become kinda detached from clowning around
what made you think of this?
You can also say clowning on but the idea of saying "I clowned," feels so wrong
How come the verb clowning is so attached to the phrase "clowning around"
i wonder if she's gonna mysteriously commit suicide too
wtf apparently ghislane maxwell (this woman who helped jeffrey epstein sex traffic children) finally got arrested
frenchtutor is also a top ten name
also dropping in to say

https://twitter.com/dril/status/1278508385575464960  michael dril responded to that medium article you linked us
Let's fucking go elkposting
Heres an elk


God dammit Barry
Yeah... that's what I was referencing totally! 
that reminds me of my fav ed edd n eddy joke when may goes 'QUICK WHATS THE NUMBER FOR 9-1-1??"
LOL
LMFAO

whats your credit card number ??
followup question
interesting
Like you have a pretty middle of the road voice to me in terms of deepness and how it sounds in general
Idk like on deepness? probably a 5
in a range from woody woodpecker to the Darth Laser from fairly odd parents
so @Barry Tessler how do you process my voice
interesting
A snippet i found from some online question site about the topic
"As the other two have said, the voice you hear sounds different to you because you hear it through reverberations in your skull. The weird thing is youre actually the opposite of most people - this effect makes their voice sound deeper to them than it does to other people.  It could be that youre just not a very accurate judge of voice depth. Bigger, stronger men tend to be less sensitive to these features than women and less physically imposing men,[1] so maybe that explains it."
thats probably the most tilting thing to me
on the record fuck people for making remarks about voices/laughs
iirc most people hear their own voices as deeper as they speak it
And i dont know how that compares to hownother people hear themselves so i was curious
Ok cause like, i dont hear my quote unquote accent.
But its more treble-y when I listen back

I dont hear my voice in the way that it actually sounds
I feel like I have a very high voice or a very low voice
Like, is it close to your actual voice?
Yall how do you hear yourselves
DeBlasio activates my fight or flight
I laughed but I knew it was true
When you explained to me how deblasio wouldnt cancel school for even the avengers
Aint that the truth
But sometimes shit aint funny 
Yaseen you literally have the most infectious voice for comedy
Yeah I hate the sound of my voice too
I want that radio host shiiiiiiiiit
My voice comes entirely from my throat and idk how to change that bc it sounds DORKY
Id mix up worse and worth because to me they sound the same
It even impacts my typing which is something interesting Ive found
Idk its not just my voice but my inability to say certain words
i think it's a common insecurity
Im reallllly lucky people thing i have an accent cause id they didnt id never ralk
omg same i hate my voice and want to speak better!!!!
Been meaning to do so for a while
My voice is like a big insecurity of mine
I lowkey might come back as Colonialism or something cause the r in crowsong fucks up tos sometimes
Oh wait what's this about? I want to speak clearly too
I wanna clear up my speech a bit
I FEEL THAT
Its why I wanna do the voice acting lessons that Pauls doing
Yeah the problem is biologically I cannot talk said shit
I almost need to change my tag cause i cant pronounce Rs....
TALK YO SHIT
English language busted
If I was able to say it Id make my tag lisp but I cant
Its like sun
Like lemme just choose a weather
Their too simple imo
Rain is good but earth activates my lisp
what about the old japanese tags like rain and earth
I could be wrong so any slander should be thrown at me, I remember Null being in his tag somewhere
Its like a step away from making a tag avagadros Constant
YO THE ICONIC MR CHEF that tag bopped
Nullification actually made me a little upset just now
Flow was the gang
DietCake is fire
Or maybe Null was his gang
Barles Charkley is another good one
But usually Dre Charles/Bre Bharles
Hm
Nullification at one point I think
i think it's just dre
What is Dres tag
Oh PeliPenquin -shortened to Peli is flames too
sephirothken
4 letter tags are so solid
Husband bottom 10
For some reason plup makes me think of a baby duck and i love it
Wife is a top 10 tag for me
Idk hero killer sounds alright just because i associate with the fucking noseless blood guy from hero academia
If we're talking just general tags, I like Plup. It reminds me of pulp, and I like orange juice
Stain literally sounds like you shit yourself Im sorry
Mans wanted to be an anime protag so bad
Stain
Hero killer is bad too imo
Duck from melee, top 20
what about hero killer
Im cracking up cuz I was preparing the message
Anything eith duck +10
Barry I was going to bring that up. Thats ok
I like, refused to call him by his tag
What about DarkwingDuck
What the
Bro in london there was a ShadowKiller
-5 points
Anything with dark/shadow
Fuck that tag
Thats a different topic
No its the worst tag
my blissful existence has been ruined
Im not even considering the person
damn i forgot he existed for a good several months there
I wasnt gonna say it but yeah
Like now that we know the community is filled with diddlers being a dick is less bothering to me
Ok you said it
Way too edgy
Twisted Hero.
"You fucked up" proceeds to fucking kill me while shaking his head
Darkblues is my least favorite tag
You know what I mean
Sorry not anymore
Bro FUCK playing darkblues
But yeah fuck that guy but at least he's not a diddler anymore
Ok least favorite tag
IT WAS DARKBLUES
He plays Joker and Wolf
Oh wait are you talking about Darkblues
It was pretty recent
Fuck
Absolutely not
This is so much funnier if you know deaththrasher i promise
Do you remember their name tho
In fact I'm flattered you remember every aspect of my Smash career
No it wasn't rude
The only stevens belmont is dearhrasher
Someone that was like rude to you
Maybe it wasnt Belmont
It's been over a year
I think they play at Stevens
Bruh I don't even remember playing a Belmont at xeno
@Justin Jones do you know
It was blue something
I forgot
This was a freudian typo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aGDCE6Nrz0
DSMain is good too
That played the Belmonts
BigTorterraBluntz kiss me
@Barry Tessler who was the player you played at Xeno

BigVegetaBluntZ is my favorite
Do people have least favorite tags
Any tag with Majin in it raises the caliber
Cube is so good
Cube
Also stevens has the best tag free
Whoopi Goldburst
IM FUCKING CRYING
Guilty Gear has some banger tags
uyu yuyu
Interestingly enough my middle name is Colonialism if you mess around with the letters
This sounds terrible
Tied with Book
My middle name is Mitchell which is close enough to Michael
Knee has my favorite tag
queen tanukana
My sons, White Justin and BLACK MICHAEL
and then allen saying a panel of only justin lmao
I still think Tekken has the best tags
Oh damn
On the record: Im down
here
Cuz 80% of the people understood that immediately upon proposal
Hey so on the record when was I established as white Justin
Not necessarily the best but the most baller
This isn't from smash 4 but Big O is the most baller tag of all time
https://twitter.com/ZONEPHYSlCS/status/1278531560271015936?s=20
Oh bet
dichael
Yeah who's white justin
I dont understand this analogy but i love it
SweetBabyZays
Raios is an amazing tag
smashfox93
Nick C is one of the better "It's just my name" tags
ok we're back to the coc being justin and white justin
Dual meaning in smash
But its also the panel
It is code of conduct
oh wait coc isnt code of conduct???
Dinosaurus
Jet ultra
Yeah CoC is a Twitter account comprised of ??? That determine global bans such as those of Ally and Zack
Clui
Yes, https://twitter.com/AllyUltimate/status/1278733577392467968?s=20  They knew about nairo
Mono and Pret are both so clean
COC stands for Code of Conduct?
Wait someone clue me in
I really like Monos... some with Pret
I think it should be bars the journey because even if he isn't nyu the strength of the tag compensates
Fuck that shit burn it down
BRO I JUST SAW THAT
I told u bro they are SUS I saw the ally tweet
Sketch is a good one tied to a bad player so it cancels out like Pemdas
Its Scooter until I think of another one
@Yaseen Mohamed i changed my opinon FUCK THE COC
Im trying to think of my favorite NYU tag
Because of that game
My life has genuinely been downhill since spring 2018 lmao
I went 1v3
That was the peak
Barry when we were on a team
and mega
Now Im 22 and still doing that
nyu smash has good tags
And we did like Bowser vs Dedede
My condolences
Like i love tags with meaning behind them
It was at a spring fighter I think
Yeah a lot of people do
I remember the first person I ever played at a smash event was barry
Then you told me about what it means and i fucking DIED
So did I
I thought it was a metal joke at first
IG
INGAT IS SOO GOOD
igat
INGAT (I'm Not Good At This) works as ING (I'm Not Good)
I take it back Allens perfect
Ow
Most tags are bad at being shortened tbh
I'll never forget hearing about a freshman who plays bayo and pacman like me
So ill keep it forever
I was 12 when i made the tag and shortening it to cast sounds bad
Cultured
I will never forget hearing about a freshman cloud named castdream. That shit was OD. Like the culture in playing a FF7 character with your tag being after a dreamcast
agreed
Honestly it's a very high-tier tag in both concept and how it sounds in practice
It's DreamCast with the order of the words swapped
Cell
What does it mean
my first interaction with ed that I remember is asking what castdream means
So good tbh
My necromancer was Blaze Crowsong, and it was like, the first game i made friends with via gaming
neither did i
I don't think michael played wizard101
Colonialism
You know how youd make names by combining terms on a drop down menu?
Nah its Crow-song   Its from wizard101

then the artistic medium
I keep thinking its
Like the bird
Crow Song
Crowsong
I forgot too
I still cant pronounce it correctly
Wait what's the answer
Wait I found the answer
Justin whats your current tag
Im done with smash
Dude I would literally just pick Young Jeezy song titles as my tag toward late smash 4 lmao
This post was made by Michael changing his tag 7 times in the month of June
all the other numerals have been lost to time now as well
Imagine changing your tag
Ssbbowsla
what happened to the 5
his name pivot was more successful than even john12346
I feel like Im reading Cthulhu level texts what does this mean
This is true
You can call him Tyrell too
not naruto... anything but naruto

tbh i forgot too
Someone do the honors tho I'm not strong enough
Ohp
The sad react LMAOOOO
Is this something only yaeen is allowed to say...

Someone tell him....
Wait whats the tag mean...
Nah nakat has always been a pos so i wouldnt be surprised if he did something
On 3DS
did disney know the full tag
The game being smash 4
I remember he did good when the game first came out
nothing but i feel like his existence is an ohp cause his memory is only invoked in the modern day when ppl talk about the worst tags of history
Could be wrong
Idk if nakat did anything, i think that was just an example
I'm not up to date on any of it
God so much stuff is coming out
Wait what did Nakat do
Bro nairo,d1,keitaro,cinnpie were all big names and showed up in like every stream SPONSORED by nintendo
No, but from a business perspective you never take that risk again
didnt they have nakat on disney channel or something like they clearly dont know
Nintendo connect to the comp scene is gone, they exposed once and got burnt
ppl didnt know about nairo back then tho right?
Remember, they had nairo at an event for ults release
Pacpeople
are there a race of pacmen
Fact. But from a business persepctive this is already associated, so now they have to mitigate the exposure
Replacing with this
i wouldve hearted the lucas one if it had ness instead

I deleted it
its ok if it happens to pacman cause he has no human rights
Wait that looks bad
this is just and good
NOT THE BOY
like plenty of ppl who dont know the community that well probably think nintendo is involved and blood is just on their hands whether they like it or not


Fucking hell
yea like theyre just not good or nice or benevolent so rip
not the arms length...
ISNT she an ambassador
Didnt Nintendo endorse Cinnpie as a rep
i think getting nintendo would be involved if nintendo was good and nice and benevolent
They almost have to keep a arms length now for PR sake
I genuinely dont know if Nintendo getting involved helps
Yeah, like blizzard almost got blown up when dreamkazper was outted as a predator. That was 1 player, 2 circumstances.   In smash weve been grassroots so long it runs deep
i mean its like associated with them now kinda
They cant have ANY of the blood on their hands
I think I finally understand why Nintendo doesnt want to support smash
I get that
nintendo pls
Cause like, being a TO is stressful and time consuming and most people dont want to do it. So you have to take what you can get.   But yeah, for strong fundamental change grassroots needs to go. Which is an issue in and of itself
if only we could have a central thing like how league has riot
Also wrt vetting I dont mean to imply that vetting is necessary or verifies someone is trustworthy
Everybody want grassroots until shit like this happens
Yeah right on the money
Yeah since smash is grassroots theres no central form of moderation so people just do wild shit
I feel as though the grassroots aspect of smash has to die for things to change
I dont know if theres a solution tho
I tried to make sure the people around me represented everyone i was supposed to represent. But TOs have virtually no screening because of our community. And thats TERRIFYING when you realize the sheer level of power we have over communities
I seriously hope that gunblade didnt actually do anything bc i would be so devastated
That scares me tbh
We dont
Fuck man.......
WAIT LMFAO
Gunblade must be so fucked up rn Nairo is one of his closest friends
justin and white justin
Theres actually a rumot against gunblade rn....
we need only justin
We cant go by seniority we need to go by if they are me or Justin or not
isn't gunblade nairo's neighbor
We need the CoC to strictly comprise of Gunblade and Justin Jones
We can't even go by seniority bc Nairo has been around since Brawl
And then I was nauseous for a day
I didnt really know anyone wrt allegations that went out except for Cinnpie who I liked a lot
I get creating a community of trust but isnt the running trend that people that were thought to be good turned out to be despicable
get vetted i mean
i think they dont
Thats whats so complicated to me
Also how do TOs get vetted
Then when they got pressed about it they spewed nonsense
It's very obvious man they definitely had a bunch of people who were in on it
Like why did zack get a 5 year band for retaliating as a victim
Also the fact that they like... dont release shit about their punishment methodology is super sus
Like i think its lack of anonymous reporting means people like tweek cant come out about things. And that people have to turn to throwaway accounts like hero killer.
Its shit
Make it a part of registration imo
Yeah its basically invisible then
I think its in the right place just terribly implimented
i didnt know there was a coc lmao
The fact that no one knew who was on it compounded with the Zack ban meant that it had 0 credence...at this point im pretty sure Nairo/other Ally fans were on it
I don't know if anyone has truly seen it
I dont go THAT far. But the way they handle things is super not conducive to reform
ive never seen the coc but yea i guess we need a new one
Yeah for sure
The current CoC is a fucking mistake lmao I hope a new one is built from scratch


Oh
What does applie
Accident sorry

Trash talk, etc etc
Im not even talking about diddling here I meant like even being a fgc heel/villain
hmm yea i guess thats true
thats true but i feel like diddling is clearly not allowed implicitly today
I look at any tweet/comment and its very apparent that people arent on the same page
Like Im iffy on this because I dont even think theres an implicit understanding of what is and isnt allowed
I dont like the methodology of the current CoC but i think its a VERY good place to start for a central authority in smash
when we needed it most, it vanished
the brawl backroom had so much authority
What that does is force compliance to code of conduct by reducing risk of competion. Imo
I feel like people try but nobody ever picks up a sufficient amount of authority
Like rules dont stop people doing bad things sure but we can alleviate the absurd headache of people being like why did someone get banned for z time and not y time
pg is so powerful
Even if thats just a group of largescale tos partnering with PG to make only their tournaments count for PGR
yea we need a central government
Im a SUPER big proponent of centralizing smash
It makes the banning process very concrete
there's the brawl backroom
Like there isn't a Central Smash Organization
I think a code of conduct has its uses regardless
It's a shame because a lot of people and kids have had great experiences through smash and traveling to events and shit like this ruins it for everyone to varying extents
yea i kinda feel like if there was a code of conduct, it would be pretty similar to whats already implicitly understood and thats not fixing stuff
Of course, long term fixes rather than short term.
The reason that reforms rejected for police is that its institutional and backed by a ton of outside factors, you can reform a community
I think another thing is how decentralized the smash community is compared to gdq
Exactly. I think theres a big issue with culture here too, where we need to create a culture where people take conduct seriously enough to not support tournaments that dont adhere to strict principles
maybe the community should ban people more liberally like gdq or something
I support the use of a formal code of conduct but it reminds me of like "Police reform" stuff that the police just choose not to listen to
Man I feel like this is maybe how some older people feel about times when everyone was allegedly much more lax about things like neighborhood/home security, when certainly bad things still happened but the overall sentiment toward letting kids run around independently was much more relaxed
This is a good way to put it
I genuinely think Minecraft/fortnite cons have a similar base
I talked about this last night. I personally think that measures to change demographics arent targeting the root of issues, rather symptoms. This isnt bad as its voluntary, but it comes with a logistical nightmare of how to weigh success too. I think the best course is to formalize a Code of Condut and for people to only support tournaments that follow the code of conduct. I thi k this is a decent go between measure, but i think its pain meds not antibiotics, and its useful until we get the antibiotics, but not what we should focus on
This is from the perspective of someone who has never dealt with an issue first-hand, nor do I have any semblance of understanding as to what true reform entails and what a logical end environment could feasibly be
is there a similar community with similar age mixing that doesnt have pedos and if so, how do they do it and what kind of culture do they have
You dont have to unlaugh react, its my life source
Yeah this is a good sum-up
Wait yeah the yet was meant to make it more lighthearted
In my honest opinion I feel like a minor league is a bit of a kneejerk reaction, one that would work for sure, but also one that dismisses reform at large. I think one of the cooler things about the community is the co-existence and mutual respect of people regardless of age. While fixing the issues aren't trivial tasks, there are more things we can do to create a culture that does not allow for such behavior. The tip line and just encouraging people to be more vocal (through normalizing the outings of these stories) are good first steps
it was the (yet) that did it for me
But its also sad we dont have one
No anti abuser beam is funny
Wait sorry was the laugh react bad
There isnt an anti-abuser laser beam (yet)
I truly dont know I think the large understanding is that theres only so much that can be done at an organizational level
Right so the question to me is how do you prevent something within the community but outside of like official community events
Thats the disturbing thing too
I mean there was videos of Cinnpie being touchy at a literal tournament
D1 was at a party too I think
Apparently parties are the major problems
Puppeh and Cinnpie was largely at parties and in private it seems like
But idk when exactly the diddlings are happening. like if it's happening outside of the events themselves, like at parties and outings and shit
Smash specifically has probably the lowest bound of ages in the fgc
I talked to some other friends and they said if they were teens theyd be resistant to having their folks there
Idk how this problem is solved in other communities
I can see that helping
Sorry I meant parent:guardian
Idk what the consensus is on it
Someone brought up having an adult present for non-minor league events
Yeah in addition to a junior league there would need to be public conversations and accountability as much as possible
I mean there could still be like grooming through social media, but yeah it would probably be safer
One concern is that if there were junior events, presumably the organizers and staff would still be adults, and the premise potentially slides toward regular events
Wifi is a pretty good environment for safe competition
I mean legitimately though
let's just stay in wifi forever
maybe smash attracts pedos
the smash communitys supply of kiddos for the pedos to prey on is so much
First thought that comes to mind for me is that as far as I know not a lot of the problem is related to when people are actually playing the game
I don't even know where to start about addressing the root problem of this but the junior league could help
Yeah that sounds fine
I dont check the smash chats/discords so Im asking here if thats aight, what are peoples thoughts on creating a junior league of competitive Smash where only minors can play while still allowing their presence in most other tourneys? Like a voluntary safe space and junior circuit to keep people safe who are worried about the pedophilia and grooming people are exposing now. Big key word being voluntary. Because I dont think straight up separating ages addresses the root problems but could make sure people can play safely

so if you stopped doing that, your hair would still snap at the same point so youd have to wait to exceed the old maximum
While were here I havent shaved since quarantine started
theres some things that ruin your hair maximum not at the follicle by weakening the actual keratin like when you iron or straighten your hair
i dont think so cause that would make it just not fall out at the follicle when it was gonna
would it only have impact when a new hair that begins now reaches your old maximum
well like if you did something to increase your hair strength right now
but like generally no
like if you just messed up one follicle somehow
ehhhhh it could be i guess
is the strength of each individual hair separate
i havent gotten a non-bangs-only haircut in a couple years
My sister said she hadn't gotten a haircut in years and I was like omg
i really want to grow my hair long but my max hair length is so short cause i had a bad bleach job 
I didn't know there were max hair lengths until last year
I was thinking about this because I feel like my effective length growth is slowing down and then I thought about everyone having different max hair lengths
I think it's just called a curve, but the "thing that it's approaching" (in this case 1 on the y-axis) is called an asymptote
like your max hair growth is a function of how healthy your hair is

I meant this one
hair doesnt start growing but it falls out at some point which caps your max hair growth
sinusoidal but that also has faster growth at the start
which function is the one where it approaches a limit slowly
Wait does hair stop growing past a certain point
no cause it has an upper bound
if you don't get a haircut is hair length logarithmic
Oh yeah I met him lol
fen is my bf who i invited to some chats without saying anything lmao
Some right wing yuppie
Who is fen
Wait a minute
Idk how to phrase it other than re-quoting they are flooding the lanes with shit
Its why whenever I see a tweet like why isnt anyone talking about xyz I just kinda gesture vaguely into the air cuz like
Not to be a grandpa about it but I think Twitter/doom scrolling has def changed the way people process news in the last 4 years
I think what the authors trying to say isnt ignore the news but questioning how much is being retained vs how much you think youre retaining
Oh I see
Wait whats the semi joke
And I cant do that without crunching all the news and all the ideas
And it feels (rightfully) that I have to get up to speed
I just dont have the mental capacity to understand very nuanced views of social issues
I just feel like how boomers feel sometimes
(Only semi-joking)
People who cant stomach the news should get better
Im a bad person
I ran out of brain in 8th grade
one of the things that stuck out to me is steve bannon's tactics of 'flooding the zone with shit' which was like, disturbingly effective
https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fonezero.medium.com%2Four-ability-to-process-information-is-reaching-a-critical-limit-3c761fee3259%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0sTHd2UhaQ7xw7qavsobrg4IBgvmKeSCmzTcZKSbyIrkUWNYRCiuz_cOo&h=AT0kKRBz_SkiRa0bh92WIM7CqA3hx_dIQ3kh93xzHcpVv4cJVpXeOWSXrjvllnJDmHWlf_ahSMS4rBmEAzAMO98jU7rqUsCp3WS4ILiMXtTmZbCH6JoUabelM_WGF9mY85rw4g  thought this was relevant for the brain expansion chat
The smash 4 cloud player saying we all have privilege, at last the light is seen
Rather than we have to know what privilege we have and accordingly listen to others more at times, but youre super good
I mean, we all have inherent privilege, and i dont think it means you cant speak on it
I also recognize I have zero leg to stand on in explaining these things because I am like, a rich white dude so explaining what privilege is or isnt to me means like next to nothing lol
Gotcha I see what youre saying
I think that is, its also fundamentally a part i dont necessarily agree with. But i think that is a fundamental tenant of it
Which isnt to ignore racial division but rather acknowledge that racial division is rooted in class at the offset of a lot of racial institutions
Like a core tenant of Marxism (I could be wrong I have not read) is the idea of class consciousness ie that class is the prevailing factor in which people are divided or at least the root
And Boots Riley pointed that out recently as well reiterating the same thing
Saying*
Like Richard Pryor was seeing in the 70s that racism was an inherently class oriented issues
Like I think that correlated with privilege like the people that have their voice taken seriously the most (via privilege) are seen as representatives of the moment
Thats also very possible.
Part of me wonders if the reason people associate leftism as a privileged white take is that the most highlighted leftism people in the current spotlight are white
^fair. I shouldve specified with modern fat leftism. Though, to be fair, even that is a slippery slope. I think i just see a correlation with people having more privilege and being far left in contemporary society. Of course its not hard and fast, and i probably couldve worded that better
Many of the prominent members were advocates for socialism/communism
But the black panther party for example was extremely left wing
For a number of reasons
I dont think far leftism is an example of white privilege but Im also not really the best point against that
It was never rooted in vitriol but immaturity and lack of proper communication basically got them memed hard by the right wing
I think "SJW" and the culture surrounding the phrase is one of the big things holding these movements back
Yeah exactly
It also became a meme, which didn't help
And the phrase check your privilege isn't a bad one, but one that was misunderstood by many during its growing phases, similar to Black Lives Matter
I mean, I guess most people would still say it isn't bad or wrong to have privilege
I think the term went through...inflation? As it got popular in the mid 2010s (check your privilege) and people started using it for more situations. That's not incorrect of them but like you said, it's very negative
Which is awkward because I also feel like the original intent was to emphasize mindfulness of comparative advantages people might have over others, but now it has a more negative connotation
I feel like the concept of privilege has expanded a lot
There's less fear of the police, no issues applying to jobs with a foreign sounding name, things like that
It's mainly to do with the ability to skip certain issues like Allen mentioned
And I guess think about what does the term "white privilege" really mean...
But I'm just trying to put things into some "perspective"?
I think there is nothing wrong with having ideals and enjoying things one enjoys
White privilege affects most things, but most things aren't white privilege
We have a lot of privilege just living in a first world country and I'm pretty fine with it
Yeah what allen just said
I also think there isn't anything inherently wrong with having privilege
I think police brutality is an example of what happens without privilege. But to say it is privilege is... language wise, weird
if anything, white privilege is being removed from the conversation of police brutality
it isn't though
I also want to specify this is NOT targeting anyone. I realize people here are far left and im not trying to call yall on priviledge. Rather just point to something i see a correlation with
I definitely think police brutality is an example of white privilege
I mean, I'm throwing out a devil's advocate argument
Where clearly race is a factor but to say police brutality "is" white privilege is just weird
Like it's clearer in the police brutality example
*issue
Policy brutality is BOTh a racial and a socioeconomic idsue
actually this might sound semantic but I think what's causing an issue here is that it doesn't make sense to call most actions or things privilege
I havent crunched all the numbers on that statistic
I thought the statistics proved that black people die 2.5 times more than white people from the police? Though you could argue that it may be bc of greater police density in poorer neighborhoods
something is easier or better because you are white
Because it correlates with socioeconomic factors
But under narrower definitions, we could also say police brutality isn't white privilege
Beyond very specific and obvious social interactions it's very nebulous
I mean i DO think that being far left is a privileged position where you can ignore feasibility since if it doesnt happennit doesnt really effect you..but i dont think its white priviledge.
I guess I should go read some textbooks
One of the central points of the discussion I guess is what even is white privilege
I think there's a lot of factors but my stance has always been that wealth will reign supreme, racial issues definitely compound it though
Which I think could fit under the broad term of "wealth"
I mean, I think it's about inheriting social capital
It's about inheriting wealth in a country with horrible socioeconomic mobility
Or even mostly about race
Like, it's not hard to establish specific ways in which white privilege could intersect with streaming but to classify streaming as a whole as white privilege is overly broad
I think racial issues comprise many inequalities but i don't think it's just about race
And specifically, I argue that one of the reasons is because of upbringing and heritage that is from generations of white people having power
The same for having the ability to stream
much greater than the % of non-white college students
It's easier to identify privilege in relatively narrow constructs even if cumulatively they add up to a lot
But I would argue that the % of white college students who are far left is
I think privilege is a pretty vacuous term since it could be argued every single person I met at NYU was beyond privileged, I mean their opportunity for a successful future was greater than that of 99.9% of people who have ever lived
I feel as though it does all boil down to economics at the end of the day, white people have the capability to enjoy several advantages that allow then to reach those spots easier situationally, but it doesn't become about race.  The far left is largely compromised of college students, and college students are largely white
X being white privilege is white privilege because the fact that someone is white provides the benefit is it not?
Arguing that _some_ non-white people enjoy X isn't enough
It only has to be biased towards it
But X being white privilege doesn't imply that it's something that only white people experience
Yeah, the ability TO stream is inherently financial priviledge but thats not always white
If someone streams or enjoys streaming you can assume they have a certain amount of privilege, but you wouldn't know that they have white privilege
It's a generational thing that almost gets embedded into the culture
It's because their parents had to work hard for a living and my grandparents taught my parents who taught me
but that would have happened anyways
I'm fortunate enough to have parents who could support me if i failed
Yeah, i think @Yaseen Mohamed said it best when he said "tisch actors are either risking everything or  nothing" paraphrased
That's what I said
But more just priviledge in general
But i dont think thats inherently WHITe privilege
I DO think that certain paths in live are reserved for those who have the money to risk failing
If I wanted to study something like political science in college, I would be recalled home and beaten
It's not _just_ a socioeconomic factor
For example, many non-white parents came from places with far left regimes and actively discouraged their kids from thinking certain things. Similar for gaming / streams
Sectors of debatable white privilege that hinge primarily on economic factors dilute the concept of white privilege
I would say no
What I'm trying to hit at is that some of the concerns (e.g., streamers talking about abusing cats) just are too remote for many to care about.
Related: is being far left white privilege?
Is streaming and enjoying streams white privilege?

Such good design
I love dr Coyle
im dr c
It escaped. First, it started thinking... and now Hedlok is apparently on the search for something. This is an emergency, but the doctors interest has already moved on to other issues. For example, can we make a version that can be worn easily? We will leave the handling of Hedlok to the ARMS competitors... from here on he will truly be their sparring partner...
We are stuck trying to solve a major problem. Dr. C rejected our proposals to boost brainpower and enable multiple arm control in a normal person. Based on the doctors theory, we started to test whether we could extend thinking to the wearable weapon. Thus, we changed the mounting position from the torso to the head. The doctor keeps close contact with us, but never shows himself in person. I am becoming worried.

In Chinese you would definitely just say grandpa and it would sound fine, but it feels weirder in English
that might be the most reasonable option
Bu lt thats also just my family
So it prob just say grandpa.
That was Papa and Sweetiepie for some reason. But other than that its Grandpa Ron, Grandpa Hudlow (great grandma moms side) etc.
to be clear this is if you were actually communicating with their spirit or if they were alive somehow
Except my Great Grandfather and Grandmother on my dads side
My family has always referred to sets of grandparents by names
saying their name might also be weird
like, you can't straight up address them as ancestor
especially if you have living grandparents
Wouldn't it feel weird though
I specify race as thats important for ancestors i think
The black side would prob be like, papa and something
I mean, my family is white so probably just "Grandpa _____ and Grandma ____"
which I think would be 3
Like beyond the point where you can reasonably say all the greats
How would you address your ancestor
Some people in this chat wont even have to imagine that
Imagine reading this without knowing that Mr. Omar's catchphrase is "tragic!"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7QMbETH5So
tragic
and i asked what this was supposed to do and then he just disappeared
and the power i got was that my right thumb was like way too big
i had a dream once where everyone in my elementary school got superpowers cuz a wizard came to visit
hitting andy with a car
getting hit by a car
if there was a point in your life that caused you to become a superhero what would it have been
everyone else just seems inconsequential
Batman
who do you know irl with the saddest backstory
Is the question has everyone had something sad happen to them in their lives
i still dont agree that the prevailing factors are negative
does everyone have a sad backstory if not tragic
cause the writing has to be thorough, but youre still allowed to use the highest priority plot device in writing
but when there are real batmen it's like uhh
I feel like it looks dumb when civilians hate on superheroes in comics
writing for batman is so tricky but so fun
hes obsessive and paranoid
clinically not at all lol
I don't think he is
Is Batman sane
i thought of 3h lmaoooooooo
thats a good podcast name
it's objectively batman
who was the first person you think of when you think tragic backstory
lol i was just about to ask
as soon as the topic was raised lol
I did think of Batman first
actually superman might count
funny you didnt instantly think batman
But Spider-Man is directly connected to his tragedy
Superman is a pretty good example because the connection in that case isn't as strong
I feel like there also has to be a relatively strong connection between the tragedy and the current identity
is the death of his entire species a tragedy
what if he was 19 when krypton was destroyed and he was sent away
does superman have a tragic backstory?
ive lived a super comfortable life
i dont have a tragic backstory
Even if you get shaped by hardship you don't necessarily have a tragic backstory though
cause there are places that are so fucked up that everyone living there automatically qualifies for tragic backstory status
like is it possible to not experience hardship
would those people think they've faced something bad that shaped them tho
now you could make a case for location
its probably a majority of people tbh
but like, there are tons of people over 18 that have never faced anything significantly bad
but i have to exclude babies or something
like how people say everyone faces difficulties and problems in their lives and you just don't know
why is age important
wait im just trying to figure out the variables here lol
literally everyone??
like is there some age like 30 where everyone has some tragic backstory
like everyone in existence over 18?
but beyond that just having a tragedy in your backstory isn't enough to characterize it as a whole
the question revolves around what counts as a tragedy
and that doesn't mean u peaked
but then you have a tragic backstory like "my parents were abusive" or "i lost my parent as a kid and had to raise my siblings" or "i had 30 jobs as a kid" and then that's why you are the way you are
I guess I dont understand the meaning of tragic backstory here
if you peak before 18 you don't have a tragic backstory, you just have a tragic story
For it to be tragic it has to progressively get worse
Only if you peaked before 18 right
Probably not
Oh
in life
In the game or in life
no
i can't remember if i asked before but do you think everyone over the age of 18 has a tragic backstory
damn that made me think everyone is who they are because of their lore, or in spite of it
Lee Sin's lore is just a bunch of words that inevitably justify why he's blind
Lee Sins lore has been rewritten to the point of it being a mess

Watch all of them right now
Omg whaaaat
no
Did you watch the si cinematic
for all we know we could be inside now
Yeah when she comes out of the lantern in the cinematic that's the first time she's ever been out
Do you think they had houses
oh wait she built it inside?
There seemed to be enough structure for her to build a relic cannon
Did the other entities inside it form any type of societal structure
What was daily life like inside it
How long was Senna in the lantern
In the league universe at least
Prodigal canonically applies to only ezreal though
prodigal sounds like od but negative
Yeah my grandpa was a minister
it's funny that thresh is canonically so evil but also a support
wait are ur parents christian
i've only been in a church once for my aunts wedding to a catholic guy
wait while we're here what was the harrowing
Yeah i went to sunday school until i graduated highschool
Have you ever gone for any extended length of time
andy did u go to church
i also thought prodigal son was a son who was a prodigy
Loool
i would burn in a church
Thao church?
WHAT
Haha why god and vampires
Thats good to know
Ever since Summoners got retconned the lore has been in a grey area
They really did a lot of universe expansion on the site more recently
Cause the lore team is a relatively recent addition
real life
League
For league specifically or like in general lol
I haven't finished reckoning with the coexistence of God and vampires
I don't know how to describe that better
It never occurred to me that a person or group of people write the lore
this backstory basically turned into pet sematary
The ghoulish Chain Warden was a dangerous foe, and when Senna called to withdraw and regroup, Lucian refused to turn back. Throwing himself blindly into the attack, Lucian realized his mistake as Thresh gained the upper hand. Senna stepped into Threshs path, imploring Lucian to run.
wait he actually learned his error in the next sentence
the error
The ghoulish Chain Warden was a dangerous foe, and when Senna called to withdraw and regroup, Lucian refused to turn back.
The bible
I'm reading lucian's backstory for the first time
The story of the prodigal son is that he returns after learning the error of his wasteful behavior
omg why was that in the arrow


Regardless of whether or not he learned something it's a funny head canon
wait what does prodigal mean
Well he's going to be returning is the main point
what's his socioeconomic status
it is kinda funny but I don't know how apt it is to call lucian prodigal
Wait the definition of prodigal seems like a way funnier reason to name it that than the definition for prodigy
so I was going to call it prodigal lucian but then I looked it up
with lucian and tortured prodigy in it
I was naming my LoR deck
Did you use it wrong and get corrected
Lol how did you find out
Lots of pretty good insight on the basis of civilization
I think the bible or at least abbreviated retellings of certain passages should be required reading
And prodigies are progeny that youre proud of
The father was proud of his returning son for learning his lesson
Well they both stem from the word proud
the son who was a prodigy
but I thought the prodigal son was like
no
Did you go to church growing up
wow I just found out prodigal isn't the adjective of prodigy
but if a Pillar Man combines the Stone Mask tech with the Red Stone of Aja they can become an Ultimate Life Form which is just some absolute fuckshit
A Pillar Man who activates the Stone Mask just gains additional superpowers (they're supermen btw)
Theyre actually metamorphic rocks
the purpose of the Stone Mask is that it performs acupuncture on your brain to ascend you to a higher being
in the jojo lore vampires are what you get when you put activate a Stone Mask on a human, and Stone Masks are the invention of Cars who is a Pillar Man who is just some kind of species separate from humans that turn to rock in the sun to protect themselves from sunlight because it melts them like vampires
I need to grapple with this knowledge
It would appear so
So god and vampires exist just independently
iirc God exists in the JoJo canon but he has nothing to do with vampires and so vampires aren't weak to crosses in the JoJo
Shooting
Omg I thought you said done shorting them
If you find a Holy Grail, don't disturb it
This reminds me of how when the cross works on vampires its always like, wait does the Christian god exist in this setting
Similar to like how that guy who does brave wilderness brings back animals to where he found them after he's done shooting with them
Leave it be
It's there for a reason
Well that and it I mean come on
I feel like it would feel somehow wrong to keep the literal holy grail a secret from the world, but doing anything would also be scary
I don't wanna bother it
I'd probably leave it be
Uh
What would you do if you found the actual holy grail in your pantry
I always assumed regular chalices were just grails
Yeah
Its interesting because that means the holy grail is referring to like, the grail which is also holy, and not the particular grail that is holy
iirc in the indiana jones movie you needed to pass a test of finding the holy grail amongst a bunch of regular cups, but are those regular cups just non-holy, regular grails?

Im not sure actually
I would assume so
Are there regular grails

If the protagonist is in the new time space setting then its a timeskip I think
Yeah Ill call it a timeskip
Reverse timeskip
Thats a good point
Hmmm
What about when Marty went back in time
Cuz it already happened
Yeah cuz the time wasnt skipped if it was in the past
i feel like timeskip are forwards only
Is a flashback a timeskip
At what point is it considered flying

just in general getting/pronouncing words wrong is hilarious
it's so simple but it is always so funny to me when someone says the wrong name because they clearly don't know / don't care about the person
can saying someone's name wrong be its own item in the humor list
I dont know if thats a unique take or not
Now everything is that one shade of greenish-gray and is soul/wisp like

Evolving backwards would be something like atrophy
If evolution is always defined as adapting to your environment then it'd be the latter
Is it possible to evolve backwards or would you simply be evolving forward into what you were before

so you can't just classify them all as jokes forever
because basically all everyday statements have been said as jokes at some point
well that makes it complicated
which requires an amendment to the definition
I think if it's an established joke, then saying it with any intention makes it still a joke
I guess those are separate cases to be considered
or something you said just happened to be funny to someone
sure
like a known joke
So then what if you say a joke, but with no intention of making people laugh
11 is the apex
or a feature
Which isn't really a problem, but it is a consequence of the definition
true
If the defining requirement is the intentionality, then anything could be said as a joke
so if the intention was there, its immutable
according to you
well the intentionality makes it a joke right
or intentionally slipping on a peel
Like if nobody even knew it was a joke, was it still one
is making a funny face a joke
I think that goes back to my original question though
It could be good enough
why isnt "something said to intentionally cause laughter" good enough
if there truly isnt a line, then its impossible to define it
well thats the thing right
it's easy enough to generally identify what things are and aren't jokes, but defining where the line is, if there is one, is hard
well if you can tell what things arent jokes than you can deduce what are right
that was my inquiry
so what is a joke
there are things that are just inherently funny that aren't jokes
sure
but nothing was communicated
you can understand that it's gonna rain if you see stormclouds
people are still understanding that youre tired
what would you call it when you unintentionally yawn then
if you intentionally yawn to show someone you're tired that would be communication
otherwise criminals would be communicating their guilt to detectives via evidence
in order to communicate you need to be trying to communicate something
but youre still communicating that youre in my vicinity and youre tired
no
if i saw you yawn is that intentionality
if i heard your footsteps is that intentionality
and what dictates intentionality
why
there needs to be an element of intentionality
i dont think communication has to be intentional at all
intentional conveyance of meaning
well what is communication
even so, not everything that is visual is communication
you can communicate visually
jokes have to be communicated
why not
yeah like if someone slips on a banana peel that definitely isn't a joke
is it though
well humor is broader than jokes though

what is a joke
i wouldnt know
Like, if you intend to tell a joke but it isn't funny in any conceivable way, was it still a joke
Is there a certain threshold of viability a joke needs to cross in order to exist as a joke
would there be a replacement like with the shichibukai
if we successfully destroy the great barrier reef like i hear we're doing is it 6 natural wonders
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Natural_Wonders_(CNN)
I suppose
Is aurora borealis part of nature
They're part of nature
Why
Yes
Are beaver dams and bird nests natural to us
Are manmade things natural to animals
And only reconciled by fear or mu inexperience
Some games the difference is too big though
If you simplify it to "this character is bad" and "this character is worse but can randomly win sometimes" then it all makes sense but it's possible that the gap between "bad" and "worse" isn't enough to make any concrete difference
The mean vs. standard deviation comparison is mostly good but it doesn't account for the negligible differences in mean
It's like if you were trying to win a fight with 10 hp and 1 attack or 1 hp and 10 attack
Actually I think the key isn't exactly variance but the fact that some flaws are just more deterimental to winning that others
i think it's totally reconciliable if you separate it into mean and standard deviation and the tier list is just mean
Idk like if you had a character that instantly loses, and one that will always lose right before they would win, are they equally bad
Yeah like it's clearly Ganon's high variance that gives him the edge over consistently better characters but reconciling that with the fact that he's arguably still worse than them is interesting
Because depending on what you're evaluating getting 3 stocked or losing last hit is effectively the same
And then I realized that in some contexts, being comparatively better or worse is only meaningfully different if the difference passes certain thresholds
he has low mean and high standard deviation
since that sounds like a self-contradiction but it made me think about what it actually means for a character to be better or worse
It's always been interesting to me that in most Smash games he's one of the worst characters but has considerably better game-winning capacity than characters better than him
been thinking about ganon
I had nothing more to prove after 1 minute of Summit gameplay
What point were you trying to prove
You could have just stayed on the ledge
Allen why
The way he get up attacked byleths full charge neutral b

Apparently abolishing the police isnt even a new idea
White/asian is gonna happen way more in cities
White/white is gonna happen way more in the south
white ppl are richer than asians on average, but why is a white/asian couple richer than a white/white couple on average

like people aren't always preparing for the very next day but it is fair to say that people are frequently at least preparing for the "future"/"tomorrow" as a concept
(i mean in a literal sense, no. in a more figurative sense, yes)
eh i wouldn't say always
I opened BBG's stream and he said isn't life just a perpetual preparation for tomorrow

forestryforum.com, circa 2001
I love your truck.   Im looking at those blower mounts and cylinders thinking how easy it would be to base a log loader/blade off them.  Then weld a limb riser brace right off that to an exo skeleton cage over the cab.  This thing is cool.

I like to imagine all these guys getting online to chat about forestry

I googled tinder words and found this really wholesome logging forum
App Name: Destiny  Slogan: Find someone to spend the rest of your life with.  Alt Slogan: Meet your future partner, today.
@Andy Bow get the radio
where do we get the pictures of people from the future though
Because like, right now dating is still dicey so it could be appealing to be looking for partners in the near future
I think the market would be receptive
anyone wanna form a startup to make future tinder
are their atoms single
like what if the atoms that made me up are now like fertilizing a tree
that characters atoms were probably still around in the future
what if you die in under 5 years but also all your atoms are "returned"/"repurposed"
that sounds like either a goosebumps novel or looper
theres a gun that transforms you into yourself but 5 years later and then they use it on someone who will die in under 5 years and then they just disappeared lmao
that kind of happened in hitman reborn
Hype
what if their future was being your SO but at your funeral
what if you saw another guy in their future pic
So you have to question why people are attracted to you if you have a lot of matches. Did I just win the lottery?
or would it
The only time it'd be kinda alright to run into your friends
what if you saw yourself in their future pic
But also you can't see your future
Yeah I'd be down for like a Tinder where you only see people's futures
Is it your moral obligation to align your dating apps with what you're perceived as
that's actually a super interesting idea
What if you don't change but the universe distorts to drastically alter everyone else's perception of you
My profile pic is from 2016 so I'll agree until I change it
like if you get a buzzcut today but don't update your pics, that wouldn't be catfishing right
its all good
o jk its only 3 years old
is pauls profile pic catfishing
okay thinking about it more I feel like the 5-year-old pic shouldn't be catfishing
what if your pic is of you but 2 years in the future
I feel weird when I see people's professional bio photos knowing that they're possibly 5-10+ years out of date and it reminds me of how you can only see the past versions of stars
Like I'm not the same person I was at 20
This reminds me of something I already brought up in this chat but
yeah but your identity/beliefs/attitudes might have very well changed
Well past a certain age you most likely wouldn't look that different though
I don't think you'd be able to draw a concrete line in the sand as to how much you can change
Unless you look literally the same
I think that crosses the line to catfishing
That's catfishing to an extent
What if your pics are from 5 years ago
it's lying but it's not specifically catfishing
like if you just lie about your position at a company i don't consider that catfishing
as well as identity
my understanding is that catfishing requires a certain "level" of deception regarding appearance. like michael's example is a guy lying about being the ceo of a company he worked at but did he misrepresent his appearance? Age? like the term catfishing comes from a 2010 documentary and a sizable part of the deception in that documentary is appearance based
I feel like only if you've been actively taking advantage of the deception throughout that time. Like if you're just pretending to be someone's friend and not gaining anything out of it then I'm not sure
There are multiple factors of circumstance and intentionality
Even outside of romantic contexts like you could conceivably pretend to be someone's friend for a while but if it was for a time span of decades can you still reveal that it was a long con
This is actually a tangent of what I was thinking about originally which was that generally how successful a deception is scales with how long you maintain the con for, but can you cross a threshold in which you invalidate the fraudulence of whatever you were actually doing
What about by mail
Did they meet online? Thats where i put the line
Good question Im not sure what the official catfishing definition is
Or where would you draw the line
Uhh
Does that qualify as catfishing or is it just like regular deception
Well that's kind of my point though
Said he was the ceo of a company that went under and was a multimillionaire and he was like, just an engineer there
i think paul got irl catfished about someones age
Is Superman a real life catfish
Guy lied about his entire history
I know someone that got irl catfished but it wasnt about appearance
No its real
Is catfishing strictly virtual? Like if you lead someone on in real life, it's something different?
but they made it a passive
sounds like an ult
so i don't know if it's fair to say they're "casually" dead reckoning
i think they genuinely do devote a good chunk of their brainpower to dead reckoning
i'm only half-joking about this
i think they do it competitively
i don't think they do it casually
How are animals just going to casually dead reckon
I was intimidated when this term came up while I was reading about animal navigation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning
This is so important

every other pushup is just a repetition of that

Yes
Can i do the arguing anonymously
idk if i'd live to 35 if i had to also argue with strangers on the internet
hyper focus from stimulants is a double-edged sword for me already bc it also ratchets up my mood swings/depression to the max
I say no to this hypothetical, I dont really want hyper focus and I dont want to argue with strangers
DOES EVERYONE HAVE THIS

You have 30 apples but actually 10 of them are oranges, do you eat all 30 apples So I have 20 apples? If you wanna look at it that way
Conservative trolls on the internet
Actually lets make this worse
You have 12 hours of hyper focus but you have to argue with strangers on the internet for 4 hours
Im-
Ok this works too
Why not say 12 hours?
So its not 20 hours?
minus sleep
But Fen said 20 hours of the day
so like not focus for 20 hours
you have focus for 20 hours - sleep
I mean... is arguing with strangers on the internet sleeping to you?
How are the other 4 hours of the day not sleeping
You only get hyper focus when you are awake
Am I in a quantum realm in this scenario
No
So the 4 hours are sleep
20 hours of the day is hyper focus
Yeah
Theres 24 hours in a day right
Hold on
Andy JRPG Line
No you only get 20 hours - the sleep you need
Wait is the idea here that I spent 4 hours sleeping every night
But you argue with strangers on the internet for 4 hours daily
Have Ritalin-like focus for 20 hours of the day minus sleep
Would you take this trade
omg i constantly moving stage
the floor is the real hazard
I wish sv platform was just its own stage
It has to be right
Is air the healthiest food
air is a health food
mix v8 and seltzer
why not just carbon
We must make carbonated soup
And if soup is a "health" food due to it being very high in volume but low in calories
the fthrow scalding fludd was on sv platform
MikeKirbys name begins with M so he wouldve been a great candidate for 2020
thao the scientist
OMG SCALDING FLUDD LOL
acid makes u feel fuller and also the gas pressure should make u feel fuller
MikeKirby is lucky he didn't die to fthrow scalding fludd in 2020
Smash for Wii U
it also looks like the medicine that would damage you
I thought it was candy when i first saw it
It does a lava-esque gloop
that's what I'm saying
doesnt botw?
i feel like it's not that clear what'll happen when you touch the luncheon kingdom soup before you touch it for the first time or unless you see one of those lava guys come out
Wait what games have damaging hot water
But I havent had it in over a decade so maybe it's just above average
v8 splash is actually crack lol
Oh my goodness Andy marry me on the SPOT
what age does it start hurting
v8 splash tropical blend is the best drink on the planet
v9
This country as a whole does not talk about v8 as often as it should
v8 of any temperature would either hurt or heal you depending on your age
This could be complete bullshit but I've heard that carbonated water would keep you fuller than regular water
itd taste like V8
Carbonated soup sounds interesting
just put like some carbonation
damagingly cold water is already iffy visually
well the soup could be water
The Floor Is Lava
They had their chance to make a boiling water hazard in SMO and they squandered it
like how did they even know
what was the first game to use lava lol
I mean for all we know the water in sm64 is hot
otherwise it's too hard to make visually clear to the player
If an enemy starts splashing water on you i dont think you'd think it'd go so bad
or lava
just make it yellow poison or something
I guess that's hard to give context
cause how would u visually make that clear
how come there's so little damagingly hot water in games
ya sold me
It could be a lot of surfaces but i always think of ice with that cold blue water from super mario 64 under it
i think of it like archaeological excavation
You're atop the ice
Scratching the surface is like an ice analogy no?
LOL WHAT
otherwise it's gonna fall on u or like where are u???
is a thing
i feel like you're definitely coming from above lmao
scratching the surface
no the phrase
wait is this a thing
but like the idea is that there are way more possibilities so youd be thinking more "upwards"
above
when youre scratching the surface are you coming from above or below it
If you are anticlerical, are you anti Semitic and an islamophobe or neither?
I don't know much about singapore but everything I've heard about it is that it's basically corruption heaven but the "trains run on time" so to speak. like there's absurd awful stuff going on but it's not "dysfunctional" in the sense like nyc is where the basic infrastructure is garbage
I agree its pretty wishful thinking but its not like you have to imagine a different earth
Singapore and Japan are reasonably like this
There is some but not worse than today
I mean I answered it in the scenario
in outright fascism? or in neoliberalism, which is basically fascism with extra bureaucratic steps?
it's just how is that corruption going to manifest
well that's one of the only things that was safe to bet on
yeah, it's just that the situation is so volatile that anything is technically plausible
And preempted some questions like, what if there was super corruption?
I originally asked this question but its not so clear what this actually means so I sketched out some plausible worlds
There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin  the 2010s were eventful in some ways but were ultimately one of those decades where nothing fundamentally changes. 2020 so far has been a week where decades happen, and there many more decades to come in the following weeks
It is, from what I gather, a part of the American identity / brand / whatever that it is at least seen as democratic. How much do you value that is the question... and Id like to hear your opinions
https://twitter.com/seanrmoorhead/status/1248065386714558465?lang=en
it's a joke that was made by some person on twitbird
What*
The WHAY
like we're entering what is facetiously entered "The Cool Zone" where explicit and overt crimes against humanity become very very possible
Portugal seemed to do it reasonably well.
again it could turn out better i might be too cynical
bc the ruling class of capitalists greatly enjoy neoliberalism bc it fattens their pockets
wait why is that? like necessarily a one party state will be neolib at best?
but that's just it, whoever we substitute will be exactly like julian castro in practice
and "the eyes of the international community" mean nothing. the us is a declining empire, absolutely, but it's still an empire
I dont know man, I picked Julian castro but you can feel free to substitute him for anyone else
but we're not gonna be a 1 party state without the 1 party being either neoliberal (meaning no universal health care etc) or explicitly fascist
Where it is also functionally a one party state
This is why Ive balanced it out in scenario 2
One party sounds like a very slippery slope
I dont know how to not base things on a million assumptions for this question. I think fundamentally the question to be asked is are you ok with the US being a one party state in the eyes of the international community
i guess it's like would u prefer a one party system where the 1 party is progressive dems, or a many party system
idk both of these scenarios are just like.... based on a million assumptions that come from nowhere. in 1) julian castro was a neoliberal ghoul under obama. and neoliberalism is never "reasonable" leadership. it directly leads to its own destruction, specifically at the hands of fascism, because the only thing neoliberalism is good at is crushing leftist movements specifically. the whole idea of "international prestige" is like... politics isn't about aesthetic ideas like that to me, it's about economic relationships, the power those relationships endow, and how that power is leveraged.  the "(very similar to the situation in Germany)" in 2) is true also for post ww1 germany, and we know very well how that played out. the social democrats supported the creation of the Freikorps which crushed leftist parties and was easily co-opted by the fascist nsdap. the social democrats killed rosa luxemburg.
Or 2.) this starts off the same. The US introduces mixed member proportional and the republican and democratic parties immediately splinter. There is a constant negative majority of extreme far left and extreme far right parties that forces centrists to form a fragile grand coalition (very similar to the situation in Germany). President Nikki Haley and VP Amy Klobuchar    enact a bunch of interesting, but ultimately centrist policies such as healthcare pricing caps and drug bounties, which screw over health executives (and makes the system extremely efficient) but also mean people still die from being too poor. The US is still seen as a democracy and international standing improves.
1.) after storming the White House and burning DC, the Republican Party is outlawed in the constitution. Right wing activities are totally suppressed through voter intimidation, death threats, and other nonsense you see in democracies like Japan. The US is reasonably well led as a single party state by president Julian Castro. Theres some corruption here and there of course, but  its nothing worse than whats already present today. The world doesnt consider the US a democracy anymore and theres a major loss of international prestige, but lots of left-wing policies are enacted like universal health care, etc
So which one of the following massive change scenarios would you prefer to see:
reminds me of that bit from one of the asdfmovies:  A: "Hey wanna play video games?"  B: "No! You always beat me!"  A: *hitting B with the controllers* "TELL NO ONE!"

batves
Also baterangs are just throwing knives
I think LoZ invented the returning battle boomerang
Boomerangs are based on air flow so once they hit something it makes no sense that they keep flying
He's essentially throwing it like a ball and it bounces back
This could easily go down the road of a boomerang sandwich chart but I'm fine with that
So there's a little bit more justification
Captain America's shield works on vibranium
Does Captain America's shield count
Yeah sokka and link need to have a talk with scientists
and they can also do as much damage as necessary
Wait I read friction too
and since they're blunt damage they can be safely used in like any setting without being too violent
Oh lmaoo
fiction
Aren't all weapons based on friction
Because they can just move in whatever way is needed
I think boomerangs might benefit more from fiction than any other weapons

Which animals have arms?  Here are some I can think of:-  Macropods (Kangaroos / Wallabies / Wallaroos) Primates Octopuses / Octopi Starfish
i googled "definition of arms" and it's all 2nd amendment results lmfao
Arms are the Great Filter
I should know this
depends
Kind of?
Wait, do dinosaurs have arms
like scientifically we should have different words for the appendages of a starfish and primates' arms
like primates and starfish both have "arms" but only primates have arms if we're talking about arms arms
idk i think "arm" means something different for primates than it does for starfish
Thats what Im grappling with, working in reverse from the given that primates and arguably starfish have arms
What in your mind is what determines "arm-ness" then
Perhaps baby arms arent either
Well starfish arms aren't really arms though
They do more leg things than arm things on average
like the structure of cats' front paws must be somewhat different from the arms of primates?
Is it though, if that structure only applies to primates and starfish
But they have to use them to walk
It's probably based on the structure of the "arms"
Cats use their front legs for a lot of armlike activities though
But it could be the second amendment yeah
I think it's the potential to not use their arms to walk
The bill of rights?
What gives them the right to have arms, but not to cats
ye
Do babies have arms
its like the space between 2 arms instead of the space between an arm and the body
do starfish have armpits
Well thats pretty much the question I was getting at, but tbh my original question was whether armpits are exclusive to primates
iirc iguanadon could walk on all fours but it had hands
it depends on where you decide that the classification of "front legs" ends and "arms" begins
What about men
The only armed creature types
its also the only animal with an odd number of limbs (???)
starfish have arms
Do*
If not, so only primates have arms
Do bears have arms
Never forget that the toy story segment in kingdom hearts is canon so they technically did a prequel story
Even if TS4 weren't a cash grab it'd be very difficult to see it as anything else
They kinda set themselves up for failure with TS3
Especially since the last movie felt so ultimate
Yeah it felt like an afterschool special
But I would argue it was largely the premise rather than the execution
Toy Story 4 definitely felt strange
But the whole movie would feel like an episode of the toy story show
Maybe he has a girlfriend
I could see a toy story 5 where andy is just in high school or something
The stakes didn't feel as dramatic
Frozen 2 and toy story 4 felt like long episodes
Have you seen frozen 2
Yeah
Well each toy story is a sequel to the next
To any
Prequel to which movie
Are we in agreement on the assumption that the next toy story movie can be a prequel
https://twitter.com/BKPiccolo?s=20
the code has been cracked
That actually almost lines up with Gabby Gabby's past

idk why I did this but I graphed the amount of time that passes between each toy story movie and toy story 5 will take place 52 years before toy story 1
but do nights dawn
only he can lift the curse
we've been in quarantine for the exact amount of time hbox has been trying to win a wifi bracket
Glad you agree about bowser jr
that's how I feel about Roy
that's just the sensation i feel when i see it, they're probably being very precise
I feel like whenever an animal does a super quick motion, like a mantis shrimp punching or a snake lunging, that's mashing in nature
He pressed every button
Fish out of water trying to breath
what was the first mash
Also I think its a movie thing that eventually became synonymous with culture
Id rather dawn
Imaging dusking
Not even days dawn
Why is dawning so specific to realization

its like an expression
yeah but i say im an insect all the time
to me
I think once or twice Celia has mentioned that she's an eagle
They do nothing animal-like yeah
youre the only one that seems them that way
i dont think any of the animals actually know that they're animals
Is it like animal crossing blackface
Is it racist when your animal crossing villagers wear like frog/cat costumes

Are we the robots
Did the robots set up the entire show so they could watch humans figure out a massive mystery and laugh at them
Omg is westworld just everyone reverse unoing each other

This sounds like a funny premise for a sketch
Prove youre a human by giving your ssn
I can't wait or captcha to ask me to give me an SAT essay prompt

When I think media I feel like it has to be produced through a screen for profit so Id only answer F

anyone wanna help

Because I was thinking, if a COVID vaccine came out right now, and you didn't want to take it I feel it would be somewhat reasonable but as the amount of time/testing gradually increases you would eventually cross the antivaxxer threshold
@Simon'sFriends
Yeah, it's terrifying
I talked to Thao about this
But they could possibly poison a large amount of people
But this is also a of things in life
Oh absolutely
There are so many variables and entirely different experiments
I wonder how far scientists can accurately project results
will make it through all the rounds of testing*
like regulations on drugs/vaccines probably aren't as good as they can be bc our government is owned partially by the pharmaceutical industry, but there's probably still very little chance a vaccine that'll fuck me up for life or kill me will come out
I mean... idk I feel like there have to be enough rounds of testing that won't actually happen
If they released a covid vaccine, but you knew it was rushed and kinda cut costs would you get it
rather than*
Yeah, but that can also be argued to be just like "the absence of wonder" whether than "the presence of [whatever the opposite of wonder is]"
It can be argued that its not doing wonders
Doing terrors?
Whats the opposite of doing wonders
/ot/

i knew pigs were smart but damn
For some reason my team did a virtual tour of an animal sanctuary and I learned that pigs can play video games and chickens learn to count to 4 before they hatch
That's like the one thing that you can actually say it got so extreme it looped back
I messed up my sleep schedule so hard it corrected itself


Full time jobs walk so that quantum state alpha jobs can run
It's part of it
Obsolescence is not the opposite of advancement
Which is understandable but not ideal I think because that type of justification is what leads to terminology becoming obsolete when reality advances
But I suppose it mostly holds up if you discount time fuckery
It's bound to realistic standards of time allocation
Im just saying the terminology here seems questionable because full isnt bound to anything
Teachers take the entire summer off cause schools are out
Would you consider yourself to be working full time
There are actually set definitions if you wanna adhere
So imagine if you live in another dimension but you can travel to this one for work while having a lot more free time in your own dimension

Going back to the scenario where you have more time
Okay what if you can only retain consciousness for 1 hour per day but you only do work while awake
But if you don't need to sleep you might be
Yeah unless you were like a pedantic ahole
I assume you would because the full here is probably referring to the full regular workday
But would you still say you work full time
The regular work day would be a smaller component of your time
Well at the end she never had any extra time at all
Or if you just dont need to sleep
Like if you have whatever Hermoine had in prisoner of Azkaban
How could you have more time than them if your working the same amount of time
If you had more time than other people but worked the same amount of time normal people do, would you be working part time or full time
Well attire is a spectrum
Like if you have a part time job and say youre semi unemployed
Isnt that weird though
So going semi casual is a downwards dress modifier
Or in the context of like an important event
I think in the context of business, everything is presumed professional by default
Is a semi-casual semiprofessional, or half something less than casual
dbz piccolo is piccolo jr
ye that's piccolo "sr" if i understand his backstory right
And he had a base/home while evil
Piccolo was the big bad I think
Or most of it at least
I read dragon ball
i never actually watched or read dragonball, just z
like piccolo we refer to normally and think about is the reincarnation of another piccolo who iirc was more evil
I guess after he fused with Kami the floating place becomes his home
i believe it's important to note that piccolo specifically had a unique background even for namekians
Even so I imagine hed get a home at some point over the decades
iirc they canonically only need water
i mean they don't reproduce the way slugs do but there's literally a namekian named lord slug
They dont seem to eat or sleep, and can regenerate and reproduce asexually
Uh, iirc they're like slug people?
Or plants
Animals
Are namekians even like
iirc no
Does he ever tire of vibing though
he's vibing
ye that's his thing
Everyone else has definite houses but I only ever remember piccolo meditating in nature
Because he goes there
how do you know lol
He doesnt live there though
well actually theres like this floating temple that he goes to a lot
Does he have a house
dbz japan
On earth
Yeah but where
but he lives on earth now
hes from namek
Where does piccolo live

the matrix solidified them in 1999
there were just random inconsistent colors each year until 2000 solidified them
I feel like the colors have actually influenced people dangerously
Everybody was just down with the colors
So like
Wait wtf
i actually took luvox like 10 years ago. didn't help much
Blemocrats
holy shit i just found out republicans are red and democrats are blue because there were no consistent colors until 2000 when the nytimes had their first full color electoral spread and decided to make republicans red cause red starts with r lmao

I actually cant tell the difference between doom and his bot
So i just default thought this was a deep tweet lol
Actually forgot leffen tweeted

The jury is out basically
https://www.livestrong.com/article/351168-what-are-nuts-a-fruit-or-a-vegetable/
What about nuts
(the top answer starts with "All fruit have peels"
my first instinct was yes and a cursory googling said yes also  https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-fruits-have-skin-and-some-don-t
Do all fruit have peels


Dont remind meme
my body is always erect
If you get cold enough your entire body is erect
the blood goes to your inner organs
a bit
if you get cold, do you lose the ability to have an erection
imagine not immediately touching yourself when the temperature drops below 60
So I think yes it gets cold but not as fast
On top of having the heat generated by the thighs
Probably, but the dick tends to be under more warm clothes than the extremities
the dick gets cold first
when you get cold and your extremities get cold like your hands and feet, does the tip of your dick also get cold
Acting teachers are freaks
Just this chill old lady in sweatpants doing handstands at lunch
I saw that pic earlier and thought it was my old dance teacher

Let go of me and also let go of my arm which is me
If someone ever sexualizes me in an uncomfortable way I'm telling them firmly "I am NOT just a piece of meat. I'm a brain locked inside a piece of meat thank you VERY MUCH."
Let go of my arm
Let go of me
Probably both
If someone grabs your arm, do you say they're grabbing you, or grabbing your arm
It's like "i'm this because of my past and how i think" vs "i am anything because i have control" so i guess the latter is determined by you but it's less fixed
How frickin plus
Like, we actually get to live in the same time period as chris
Youre just a brain inside a pack of meat you arent really anything
You would be doing the determination though
It's an ego trap or whatever the smart people call it
Things may or may not be deterministic but they get a hell of a lot more deterministic once you convince yourself that you are a certain trait or role
That's pretty wild
We were literally given the opportunities to actually get whatever we want
I feel like ideas of who you are/were are a big trouble in general
Makes you feel more protagonisty
It's not supposed to inspire apathy
I see it as pretty cool and motivational
People can control the trajectory of their life to a certain extent, but they cannot turn it on a dime so to speak
If you were a person meant to be apathetic when hearing that maybe you just are
It exists at some level
Well again it's not a binary thing to me
So like yeah free will might not exist but who cares
The entire point of MGS2 is that you can get anyone to do anything if you properly set up the conditions for it to happen
I feel like thats a solid argument but it also encourages inaction and apathy
Maybe the Patriots from MGS could do it
at least by humans
Deterministic but incalculable
Nothing is anyone's fault
See that's what i'm saying
I mean was that really their fault
Here's my opinion on nature vs nurture:  I feel like if you say 100% nurture, it's hard to come up with a justification to try and do anything or invest yourself in anything. But I refuse to believe in any noticeable amount of free will until we find like... scientific evidence for it. Things are mostly deterministic, but people cannot comprehend all the factors that go into why something happens, so it appears random or due to people making spontaneous choices or exercising free will
Dinosaurs were so powerful and they were wiped
Debatably weve fucked up already
We had so many chances to fuck up
It totally didn't have to be someone tho
Itd be cool if it was us
But ya Im with Yaseen someone had to be born now
I wish I could laugh react Barrys sad react
There's got to be a reason we've been given consciousness at such a turning point of humanity
Its literally the only thing people clean the insides of their assholes for
No thats a happy thing
Billions of years of evolution all leading up to me getting pegged
My ancestors wont let me get any more Echidnas in feh
Luck isn't real, you and your ancestors and all of humans are and were constantly setting up chains of events
Movies dont happen in neat years though
I guess it was us lol
It had to be someone
The way I see it
Like, that sounds like a plot of a movie
Doesn't it sound a litttttle too scripted that we were born just before the year 2000
>implying humans will be around at 4000 at the rate we're going
Yeah but so were people in like 1000
We are literally more fortunate than 99.9% of humanity in history
Tell that to the people over at 4000
Cause being born into decently wealthy families at the brink of the year 2000 with so much access to technology and advancement can't just be dumb luck
Like are we only who we are because of our experiences, or are our experiences just the justification for who we are
See i wanna say yeah
Were we pregenerated
Shooting down balloons is scary, cause if you miss one that's gone forever if it's pre generated
I think it's when it's put into the ground
When the organism died millennia ago
If you happen to get a 5 star orb in your roll, but you didn't pick it, were you lucky
This is like the main theme of Westworld
This is how I feel about fossils in animal crossing.   Like at which point does the fossil get its corresponding assessment result? When it's instantiated in the game in the ground? When I dig it up? When Blathers looks at it?
Wouldn't the luck be that you picked up a rock for seemingly no valuable reason
It matters a lot
Or does it generate each one individually
Is every summon already decided
That's how i feel about rolling in gachas
This imo
Or is it unfair to weight the luck toward one end of this arc, when the fortune is derived from the sum of the parts
I feel that this phrasing isnt clear, but if you imagine this in a RPG context, did you roll for luck when you found the rock, or when you found the window
Like, if you have to break a window, and you happen to have picked up a rock earlier, are you lucky now that you picked it up earlier, or was it lucky that you picked up the rock in the moment
But when you have this retroactive kind of luck, does the act of having luck happen at the time of acquiring, or at the time of its relevance
As long as you didnt previously acquire the solution in anticipation of the problem
And if you have a problem, and already had the solution in your possession, its also lucky
If you have a problem and find a solution by chance, its lucky


Probably safer
Like jai-alai
I think they would choose a different sport
But they would still have to react faster than the speed of sound
And if someone is in danger you shine your light on them
Golf players could carry emergency flashlights around
And I wonder what recourse society would have, if any, if the golf balls were just faster than sound
It's such a sweetspot of speed that allows the exclamation to function
Shouting fore only works because the speed of sound is greater than golf balls, but if it was drastically greater than it currently is, that would greatly diminish the urgency of having to shout fore
sheik is only good in even smash games
How many times has "republican" and "mean" been present in the same sentence where "mean" referred to the statistical mean
Fair enough

Do guys say kiddo
the mean republican would bring 1/10 of a gun
i feel like republican women and disabled people are also likely to be better in a fist fight
this sounds bad but republicans are old but democrats would have more women and disabled ppl which would hurt the mean democrat in a fist fight
All their body parts would be incomplete
ok like the mean republican and democrat and not the median
i guess that answers that
Theres a lot of v old republicans
How are defining average
Republican
do you think the average democrat or the average republican would win in a fist fight


Apple Bs

what would old names for other fast food establishments be
Yeah I definitely felt older when I typed it out
I feel like if I say it I'll turn old
I think its more an older adult thing
My folks have said it
I've only ever heard my dad say it until now, so I kind of assumed it was a Britishism
How common is the term Micky Ds
Id play super smash bros when Id get a haircut
Star fox 64 is almost a roguelike
That one bit from Supersize Me put it pretty well that like they really knew how to make kids enamored with micky ds
this one mcdonalds on staten island had nintendo 64 with mario kart and star fox
If they were still around covid probably would have wiped out the population by now
Remember when McDonalds had video games
I read Fast Food Nation and it kinda went into that vagualy
Not a happy movie since he completely fucked the original owners over but its a really interesting look at corporatization and how easy it is to rip people off
About how Ray Kroc bought the first tiny family owned McDonalds and turned it into the empire it is now
If you havent seen The Founder its a good watch
I suppose its like how current old people seem old, but in the grand scheme of things theyre among the least old
It feels like a timeless pillar of civilization
Also related, Im always surprised by how relatively young McDonalds is
Idk if this is true if it was said seriously but someone on Chinese news said two countries with McDonalds have never gone to war and Im shook
I'm a crab

The more I think the more I try to put the switch in the middle and let fate decide
Im also interested in how that number changes if it has to be an on the spot decision or something you get to think over
Something I think is interesting related to the trolley problem is like, if you were in roughly such a situation and had to save either a family member/friend or a stranger, most people would presumably save the person they know but theres also a distinct tipping point for most people as you add more strangers to the other side of the proposition and I wonder what that number is like for everyone
thao when she paints
Get in here
Everyone
wow mtg has no actual limit on the amount of guys you can have on your board???? and computer mtgs limit is 200 lmao
#Thehands
wait this card isn't a joke card, he's real and blocks 100 creatures????

wait who are the ppl hired to write flavor text lmao

glad you kept your medal
Barry set his own nickname to It That Gets Left Hanging.

THE BADDIE

the real one

Oh thank god michael is here to talk about yugioh
Oh bet
yea it's one of the joke cards
HALF MANA????

city of ass?
this looks like the yugioh ripoff of city of ass

yup, busted card. the "Burning Abyss" archetype is based on the Divine Comedy
the thing about yugioh is that it's the only game i can think of that has cards that look like necroface alongside cards that look like the merfae and have it not be jarring  https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mrfae#/media/File:Mrfae-ConceptArt.png

ALIENS ARE HIGHKEY MY FAVORITE ARCHETYPE
YES I LOVE ALIENS
@alien chat

the yugioh style seems like weirdly kind of consistent, whatever it is
Ye it's actually a genuinely good card besides for the art
of what he looks like
based just on a description
this was fanart a drawfee person did of ojama yellow

there's probably more pot cards then bilgewater cards
waaaaaaaait i'm a massive fan of necroface
APPARENTLY "OJAMA" WAS A DEROGATORY NICKNAME SOME PEOPLE AT KONAMI HAD FOR HIDEO KOJIMA.  THE OJAMAS ARE HIDEO KOJIMA

DO YOU WANT TO HEAR A RUMOR ABOUT THE OJAMAS
OH MY GOD
why do they have underwear????

I still to this day haven't seen Dark Side of Dimensions
I swear Yugioh is a magical IP
is pork bellies a commodity lmao
literally what are these nouns
this game is incredible

shoutouts to avatar of the pot of greed or something
Because there's an archetype in yugioh (a group of cards designated by a shared part of their name) called "Frogs."  But here's the thing. Frog the Jam's original Japanese name doesn't include the word for "Frog"   So every "Frog" card that searches other "Frog" cards for the longest time had to include a bit saying "except Frog the Jam" until they changed the name to Slime Toad

this reminds me of when Paul and I found out there's like 5 pots of greed

@Croak
That card is legendary
OH YEAH IT'S MY MAN
Tons of trap cards like Tragedy that are incredibly niche

Yeah old yugioh cards are garbage in terms of usefulness and have waaay darker artwork
In yugioh you can "attach cards as Xyz material" which is... like, interdimensional shit
what is any part of this card
wtf is this card art

Oh i forgot
there's so many types of removal lol
units can also get transformed
removal is pretty broad

but that's a good point
Merfae are literally adorable woodland creatures who play hide-and-seek as their gimmick
I never heard the term for returning to deck before
And like yugioh has a lot of different art styles
you can be destroyed, banished, "bounced" (return to hand as removal), "spun" (returned to deck)
wait u can die of natural causes or something?????
in yugioh it works as a term bc not everything is "violent" removal
like you're out here dropping avalanches and shit and it's just called removal

ye basically
Lol the term removal is so PG
i found the mosquito and killed it
all the more reason to remove it
like poisonous in hs
is that like it just kills you
i feel like mosquitos can also randomy have deathtouch if that's a thing in runeterra
i was banking that the mosquito didnt have survival
i killed the big fly and the mosquito flew away immediately fuck
the 2/1
or the 3/3
do you kill the 2/1 with lifesteal
and i just had a runeterra moment
omg there was a big fly and a small mosquito right next to each other
I can accept that but why the duality
dad sneezes are incredibly loud
Its called the dad sneeze my coworker said
Maybe it's elaborate roundabout way of fucking with you
My dad always sneezes twice and the consistency unsettles me

Rot in hell
Fucking bastard
Oh yeah speaking of bugs I killed Johnson
I think you have to do the team assembly montage before you get the car
Step 1 for a plan could be like get a car, but getting a car is pretty far in the steps of civilization

Well if you think about the entirety of history as a plan what step are we on now
What do you mean divide out the largest common factor
Whats the highest number step that ever came first
Thats usually how people use it
1000000 >> 0.0000000001
For me if I want to denote steps I'd do 2 -> 1 -> 3
2 > 1 > 3 could be steps
or like a linked list or something lmao
like someone saying you should do the steps in this order instead
even 2 >> 1 >> 3 looks like it could be steps
Well only because its in order in this case
or like steps
i feel like that looks like not a comparison anymore and it looks like a flowchart
Like if it was 1 >> 2 >> 3 should you just divide
do ppl use south south africa
Can you use multiple greater than signs multiple times per comparison or are you expected to always divide out the largest common factor
1 > 2 >>>>>> 3

Weird beard

I like Sherb

I only swing downwards in golf
oh wait you could swing downwards
Imagine if you always had to swing at full power, so instead of putting you have to either drive the ball away and then drive it back or try to hit like an 89 degree arc
I wonder what the most vertical shot in golf history is
yeah cause my walls were white and the flies were death black
did you count the flies
i mean the thing that bothers me is the size of this mothafucka
its so hot in my office but i cant open my window anymore cause 16 flies flew in the last time i di
Made a small hole in the wall :(
Hit it with a hat
I found a mosquito on the wall
I'm naming every insect that bothers me and writing its name in the book
Dude if I had a death note forget all the shit about changing the world or making a fortune
bugwatch hour 1.5: i asked my dad to help me kill it and Johnson went mia again. i'm losing my mind over this single insect

i even have a gun example
like a crisp red delicious apple
its probably an apple

or like what is
jerky is the tardigrade of food tho
I'd eat gun orange
i feel like if you drop jerky on the ground though its over
like if you fired an orange out of a gun, it'd be over but jerky is ok
what about jerky
Thats like the opposite of thao's point, where the food became so eaten that it prepares itself for us instead
Ooh orange is pretty good
Like an orange or corn on the cob
Probably something with an outer part you dont eat
Or otherwise compromised
After being dropped
What do you mean recoverable
With soup being the least recoverable
What's the most recoverable food
i've mentioned this before but there's a shitton of diseases you can get from eating humans this question makes me morbidly curious if there's a way to safely prepare human flesh for consumption.  i wouldn't eat it because i'm way too picky and squeamish and scared of it being mishandled but i am curious if it's possible
i wonder what the fraction for earth is
and theres a fraction in the achievo window that tells you how far you are
its funny in minecraft theres an achievement for eating all possible edible things
but we can eat them anyway
the hairy legs essentially make them impossible to swallow
like, have you ever eaten tarantula
but we can assume the nature of a lot of aquatic life allows them to be consumed right?
well like a majority of the ocean is unexplored right
do you guys think there's some things rn that we think isn't edible but we haven't discovered how to prepare it, like pufferfish before they figured it out
How do I keep missing words
well out of my reach*
hour 1 of this bug being visible but well out of my but motionless:  I have named him Johnson and await him yelling:   S H O C K I N G

Sounds like a job for
It's fucking camping
And it refuses to get off
Fuck it's fucking perched somewhere i could never reach it

The bug has returned
Individual socks

There have probably been a handful of things in the history of the universe that have actually despawned
it despawned
Now there's gonna be maggots
i wish someone invented a robot spider to hunt bugs for me
I tried to catch it for 10 minutes before it vanished
Omg a fly flew in while i left the door open to carry in groceries
Is there a more suspenseful feeling of anxiety than when you're waiting for a giant flying bug that's mia to return so you can try and kill it

https://youtu.be/GYe7ce4hFlI  I love this kind of stuff. Really shows how disciplined basketball is as a sport and the real strategy and planning that goes into playmaking
Yes


This entire conversation is Return of the Obra Dinn content
Oh that's the mic drop actually
you can also shoot basketballs
damn yusuke blasted himself back so stoically

https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Ki_Blast
But in dbz it's called a ki blast
So theyre transferring the terminology
Well in that case they're defining it as the spirit gun

Dubious
wait people can shoot ki though
Aperture science turrets use springs like nerf guns to fire real bullets lmao


I think that would be a shot

what about building a robot that throws bullets
Or windex
What about a bubble gun
You're still shooting, but idk if you're shooting them anymore
What about a gun that shoots guns that shoot swords tho
but the target's perspective is getting stabbed
From the shooter's perspective yes
Nah you're still shooting
Like if you have a gun that shoots swords, you're technically shooting them but it might be better to say the act of injuring them is stabbing them
I think part of the answer might be that sufficiently distinct ammunition can override the act of shooting with their own damage word
If you just tapped the trigger
what does that even mean
Flamethrower depending on how long it was aimed at you
Yes watergun
or a flamethrower
Okay like can you get shot by a water gun
so did witnesses to atlatl damage
They kinda had to
How do you know
Well living people named death
It's only fair
I mean I suppose bystanders can create their own terminology but I think the person who was actually struck has a bit more credence
Does there have to be penetrative damage
I guess they have to live
And you strike animals too anyway
How many people have to be struck for there to be struck terminology
I don't think people have been struck enough by atlatls to have accurate words to describe it
And you don't wanna know what the shot is doing
and if that counts then why not an atlatl
The sling is doing the shooting
You can get shot by a slingshot though
The launching mechanism can't be the person
I think it requires an apparatus that shoots out something else
Hm
You can get shot by a cannon I think
Yeah I was in it too
Or a cannon
Omg i just had a dream where i was in a game that you create guns by using your blood
Because you can get shot by a gun or a bow but not by like a spear thrower?
What are the limitations on the types of weapons that you can shoot someone with?
It do be like that sometimes
No matter what one instance is cringe and one isn't lol
What if you're cringing at yourself cringing then
but if you cringe at cringe it's fine
if you cringe at something not cringe, that's cringe
Depends on what you're cringing in response to
I don't think so
Is cringing cringe
Peeing is just juicing humans

altho yeah, I can see the left side kinda as a u mad
and the dumbness being massive
for me, the meme is less about the raging part and more about the earnesty being futile
and I didn't see why they were inventing someone raging at them when it wasn't even that out of the ordinary
It annoyed me the first few times I saw it because it was about someone doing something mildly nonmainstream
No man only machine
Its evolved
Tbh I think the raging guy part is an afterthought now even though it comes first
Oh you mean like the actual meme image
the part with the raging guy
Wait so the go brrr part is fine but the machine part isnt
Actually the right side is fine I guess but the left side is literally used as "u mad"
but that aside I think it's the type of dumb that is just dumb
What are other respectable memes
which is respectable
see like I try not to complain about it because it's one of the most dangerously self-reflexive memes in that situation
meme machine go brrrrrr
I feel like it's a rage comic on the wrong level of irony
I'm not a fan
Its like the perfect way to laugh at dumb things in good humor
Im gonna be so sad when this meme dies
attention span go brrrrw
julian changed the subject every time lmao
wait actually going back up
NO NEED FOR A RECAP I JUST FINISHED THAT EPISODE THANK YOU
and here we are
and wiifit looks like shes planking
then allen mentioned planking
i asked about camping
well leffens post was extremely broad
We're at least on point G
Earthworm Jim
I still dont know how we got from point A to B
Scrolling back up through this chat was probably the most intriguing read I've had in a while
And culturally people like the Chinese Zodiac quite a bit in Japan
Its like a pretty solid track record
Yeah thats it
Ox
snake
goat
horse?
oh yea what animals are left
Doing this anyway
Look Im just saying if we get a goat next gen yall buying me dinner
Dragon
snake??? dragon???
wait what is charmander
Tiger
also incineroar
I think its more likely after gen 3 or 4 they heard the theory and were like wait lets just keep doing this
saying typhlosion is the rat tho is already dubious
Similarly Cyndaquil isnt perfectly a rat
Dog
wait isnt there a fox fire starter like thats not the zodiac
Youre right about that but eight in a row is kinda nuts
yeah theyre not even going in order
idk the zodiac animals are pretty common and there's a decent number of them
I saw that theory but also someone's response that like
Oh yeah thats actually my pinnacle character add tbh
WHAT
The only true trend I believe in gaming is that fire starter Pokemon are based on the Chinese zodiac
ok but labo man
TAKE THAt bacK
OY!
better than ring fit guy
wait thatd be so hype
And he was convinced wed see Labo Man
A friend of mine was convinced that because of G&W, ROB, and Wii Fit one new hardware characters would be added per game
I do prefer to see first party chars since I know them better but if we get like Master Chief then sure
It never sat right with me that Sonic was the fourth to last character you get in Brawl
Smash as a series will have reached its finale
it was over when they added sonic tbh
If they add Waluigi its all over
like there almost has to be someone wild in there
6 more characters is a lot lol
The only big themes I remember were cow tipping
would he tether grab with his head
Should he be Spaceworm Jim by now
Isnt sci fi and space travel a big theme in that series
exclusively for the Intellivision Amico lol
wait earthworm jim 4 is in development
I had Earthworm Jim on the GBA but I couldn't beat it
Or his counter
Earthworm Jim's final smash would 100% have Pete the dog

lol one time I was platform camping a Mac in bracket and his friends told me to fight with honor
Throw the boy a bone
But I did see a thread complaining about how KO punch breaks shields
That is fair
the main complaint about him is that the optimal playstyle against him is extremely lame for everyone involved
well the issue with mac has never been how good he is
I see people complain about Mac and hes been bottom since the start lmao
ults balance is so good
I can't believe Ridley is in smash
And if people are complaining about low tiers being too good your game balance definitely tops a ton of other fighters
Ive seen enough of M** tweeting about Ridley to be sworn off the character for life
ridley is cheap
I think the only character Ive seen nobody bitch about being cheap is Ridley
actually he might be really campy lol
Yeah true
wait earthworm jim would be hype though
And yeah I love ults roster and that almost everyone is viable
YOU TELLIN ME EARTHWORM JIM GOT TOSSED FOR <THIS>
If anything Byleth being added shows were out of options lol
I just got real annoyed when people got mad about Byleth as if that slot could have been saved for anyone important
so everyone new feels like a bonus
I'm pretty satisfied with the roster especially since in Ult a lot of characters are viable
Oh yeah I have no issue with wanting your favs
My top pick is like Dante lmfao
Is that anyone else I could want Im like not crazy about it would just be nice
Wait thao isn't your profile pic minmin
Thats what I realized the other day
Goku is like probably cracking top 10 most wanted Smash character which really says something about how theres almost no one else left to add
Bro where is GOKU
They could make a character slot thats literally all the Arms characters as separate skins and people would still be mad
i like the asian girl
I like the clown girl
People still finding ways to get mad about new characters in a game with 70+ fighters who the fuck else yall even want
I wanted Twintelle most but now I dont think I have the energy to deal with the discourse
isn't the arms character supposed to come out soon actually
they could do a fakeout between master hand and rayman for a character reveal
what about rayman
Was Smash 64 a metaphor for Nintendo beating up Sega
Master Hand is closer to Sonics glove than Marios
Shes so cool
It hurts that people think Wii fit is lame in ultimate
Maybe Wii Fit Trainer is just wearing a glove on her whole body

master hand will be the last fighter pass char
so hes more closely related to mario, sonic, mickey mouse
master hand is a glove
is she related to master hand

i cant tell which art is more horny
We should have a real life nair contest

on average bairs are probably the most difficult, but doable moves irl
that's the positive mentality wii fit espouses
we all are
It's a work in progress
You cant?
I understand she's strong but she's so strong that she can propel herself upwards by moving her hips from side to side
which one
I've been working on my core
If two people both have Wii Fit as their waifu do they side plank for dominance

Her core is OD
I feel like you have to be strong beyond belief to do that
How does she assume a Cobra pose midair
yo fsmash is Warrior
her final smash is Wii Fit
Yo I side plank
This did psychic damage to me
%100
even her ledge getup attack has a name which is "side plank"
her edge attack is called side plank
write the description for a smash move and then look it up and see how close you can get
I can dream
i think all of her moves have a name cause they all have a spirit
imagine if it was your job to write the description for every single smash move

Assumes the Cobra pose to perform a double-footed back kick.
what is bair
A lot of characters have random punches and kicks
Wii fit is so flavorful because literally all her moves are in theme
top 5 most relevant, non sexual time to post hentai


not including beruka or annette on that list
Setsuna Froppy and Wii Fit
Allens type is always so interesting to me
Idk if I can be convinced otherwise
Is wii fit trainer the best smash waifu
Is playing Animal Crossing Pocket camp camping
Is it still camping
Her crouch is a pushup
nah planking needs your hands at your sides
*planking
Is blanking just Wii Fits crouch animation
https://twitter.com/WowOwsla/status/1244767470734307329?s=20
Allen your 2020 sequel should include some form of camping
But since stages have limited space you inevitably have to repeat your circuit
Circle camping is just the one where youre always moving
And in most of them you stay mostly in the same place
Well basically theres 3 types of camping in smash or 4 if you include planking
Cause the camper is just reacting to their positioning right

@Isaac Nam
This tweet flattened like soda
Oh yeah you need way more time to age like wine
What a pompous way to put it when you only tweeted it a couple days ago
I feel like its more forgivable when the tweet in question is about something else being good
Saying that your own tweet aged like fine wine is 

Ive done 6 of these things


My high school journalism teacher was looking for people to play
(not now but sometime in the future)
Hey all, who is up for an online video call diplomacy game
Reese With Her Spoon
Im pretty sure thats the joke
Or maybe people are too busy celebrating their moms to commit crimes


And they just brushed it off
That sounds like the most agonizing death for a transformer ever
In the middle of the transformation they just threw a chain in and they literally couldn't do anything lol
I liked their unceremonious deaths
They died so unceremoniously
How did the villains not just kill everyone
Cliffjumpie got bisected and then what the girl was listening to party in the usa with that rando dude in the backseat
I dont mind the themes and story being wack as long as the robots are done good and they were for me
Yeah I guess for me the story is not a big deal since my biggest issue with the micheal bay movies is that they really dont highlight the robots well
And the tone shifted so dramatically at the drop of a hat
So many things in that movie just seemed to happen for no reason
Nah thats fair everyone is looking for something different
I generally think everyone deserves their own opinion, but the bumblebee movie just disrupted me so hard and i can't let it stand
Fight scenes were super clear and not blurry
Where the axes are mechanicalness and humanness
I liked that the robots were easily recognizeable through their designs
Is there a mecha sandwich chart
But its more focused on the robots
I guess if the idea is for it to be like a bonding story between a robot and a person probabl
It was literally worse transformers 1
Yeah
Enough to like it more than transformers 1??
What did you like about it

Leffen die
Elfen Lied
Can we all sit down and watch it together
lilo and stitch
Imo its good
Wait why did you not like it
The next Pixar movie

What about the iron giant
Me mech
Pacific rim is so good
It upsets me that you said bumblebee before just straight up transformers 1
ive never seen it tho
it has such good reviews
The bumblebee movie is so mindblowingly bad
Its probably pacific rim and the bumblebee movie that have been the only good mainstream mech movies
Now i want more introspective mech movie
I feel like pacific rim did the best possible job a mainstream mech movie couldve done
I want to see a big robot swing a boat
They need to make another pacific rim like the original

Are we predictable
I feel like many of these questions could be found easily in a stoner chat
or explore an implied assumption of the question
and then inevitably when we start talking about it, the question deepens when we consider the semantics of a word in the question
but examined in detail to highlight a weird bit we dont usually think about
and itll be about some seemingly commonplace thing or concept
like itll usually be Allen who poses the question
Questions in this chat seem to always follow a pattern

#NewProfilePic

But does that mean things look relatively small to flies
Like, is perceived size of things a result of some combination of your field of view, height and maybe your actual size
I was just walking past some birds on rocks and wondered what size the rocks were to them
Like their eyes would be zits on their otherwise eyeless faces
A giant would probably see similarly to those
The concept feels disproportionately gross to me
They make big wide lense cameras that have different fields of view
*their
Yeah but they're face would probably block a lot of their view
Assuming an equal vantage point
If a giant had human sized eyes, would things look the same size to them as if they were human
I genuinely believed this until I was like 15

Home-packed lunch was weird and it was so hard to avoid saying a copy of of mice and men
As I drew close, I saw that shed mostly finished her home-packed lunch of cold noodles in soy sauce, and that she was reading a paperback bookOf Mice and Men.
lol this sentence I'm writing is hard for such trivial reasons
Sometimes it's just packed lunch which makes more sense
I only heard it in like elementary school
But yeah i've never really heard that
Or a cafe packed lunch
i feel like i've never heard that phrase???
You coulda but like a deli packed lunch
I feel like it is
Like, where you packed your lunch from is usually not in question
I never questioned it, but I feel like the emphasis is incorrectly on where it was packed, rather than on the packaging itself
does the phrase home-packed lunch make sense
not every collective action problem*
natural selection
How do we stop them from eating so much damn garbage
*salivator
but sure, what is a garbage salivate
lmao this is literally a what about type question
and that the habit of favoring moral framings can actually keep us from seeing some solutions that could be amoral but otherwise also be effective
this was so good because it demonstrates that every collective action problem necessarily needs to be conceived as a moral one
What about the filthy garbage salivators
Whether that happens naturally or is manipulated by the supermarket or coerced morally by society
we instead need to acknowledge that the important thing is to somehow collect all the carts in one place
the person basically said that, rather than judge people for not choosing the selfless option
it was nuts
But there was this one comment that tried to approach the problem while avoiding assigning moral evaluations to different actors
The supposing of a moral problem is really effective for sure

But the second time is like alright it can't just be me
You can forgive a chunk of bad pacing because you don't want your low attention span to get in the way
but damn the idea of being a badass in a video game world is awesome
I think the second the pacing gets bad again is when things get bad

hero academia was cool when it was about the academia
Bra MHA got some crazy problems

Sky High has that idea only for ~2hrs so you forgive how bad it is
Thats why that movie was great
And now it's all over
I feel like there was a time where MHA was immune to criticism
Fucking Sky High
but the initial idea of superhero school is so rad you forgive it for a while
the writing drops off so hard

True
The inconsistency is in nuts because you can eat peanuts raw but people still say raw peanuts
Like, you can cook bread but you wouldnt really call it raw beforehand
I think there also has to be a connotation that you usually wouldnt eat it in that state though
i think that's a fair thing to say
the concept of rawness is a "before" state
are laptops raw
Uh. Well anything can be not raw so then wouldnt anything be able to be raw
Can things only be raw if they can be not raw

Don't ever say your age
Wait am I?
Barry being older than allen blows my mind
It never stops blowing my mind that there are people on the planet who were around when league first came out but weren't like 15
I feel like middle school

What if Kobe turned out to be alive and he cured covid
3 days into 2020 we almost started a war with Iran lmao. 2020 alone has been already been more eventful than 2010-2015
It seems like the rate of potentially catastrophic events is much higher in the 20s
If i had to guess? 3
So the reason I started thinking about this question was I was going to ask how many years will it take for the 20s to be more eventful than the 10s
Like we went through a shit ton of memes and cultural phenomena per year on the "scale" of the internet throughout the 2010s but I subscribe to the attitude that it was still a decade defined by gradually increasing tensions that never come to a head or are meaningfully resolved. Covid has caused the wheels of history to start turning again
But what type of change, and on what scale?
Its like something that happens that causes a change, and it may also need a distinct beginning and end
Well can we define event first
It could be argued that it would be defined in probability terms as well
Alright, but now how do we define significance or consequence?
That suggests to me that significance or consequence is a larger factor than the probability
But it would be eventful if there were established stakes tied to the result of the pull, like if you essentially win the lottery
If you had a bag of 99 red marbles and 1 blue marble, and you randomly pulled out the blue marble, its not inherently more eventful than if you pulled out a red marble
I suppose so. If it's subjective then probably it can't really be expressed using numbers
I dont know if the typical notion of eventfulness can be tied to probability
Is eventfulness a subjective thing?
There are a lot of annual events that are considered very eventful though, and they happen regularly
If it's small, it's more eventful
given what we know already
I mean eventfulness is usually defined as the probability of something occuring
So while this year is losing a lot of mid-tier events, theres a greater amount of high-scoring events and also I suppose the small events are still happening
While India locking down everything is eventful on a scale of much greater magnitude
If you eat breakfast that contributes a negligible amount to the event score
The way I see it, anything that happens adds a certain amount of event score to the annual total
Because the eventful impact has most likely outweighed the loss of regular events
I would still say this year has been eventful though
Like if the world got put in stasis for a year, it shouldnt be considered eventful even if literally everything got disrupted
Because then there would be like a static amount of event regardless of what actually happens
so I would say yes
I guess something is eventful if it conflicts with your priors
I think the olympics not happening shouldnt be an event
is it eventful if certain regular events don't occur
It could also be roughly an average amount of events
Covid has caused a lot of events to happen, but also a lot of regular events didnt happen
Has 2020 been really eventful or uneventful
The people who are only focused on looking good will gravitate toward them

Dr. Jumpman
Damn so Dr. Mario is only picking og Nintendo characters

When c3301 was coming out nobody knew what it was or who sent it
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301

So powerful
It inspired pokemon
Both the biology of cicadas and the kids' fascination with the transformation are pretty interesting
and bring them into bed and watch them transform
A recurring theme has been catching various bugs and tonight he was telling me about how he and other kids would catch cicadas just before they moulted
I've been going on walks with my dad at night and he tells me stories about his childhood
The true hero's journey
I like it because a lot of people always stress out about how life is passing by or they aren't where they want to be right now which is totally valid, but it's inspirational to me to think that cicadas can spend the vast majorities of their life underground in darkness and then they return to the light at the very end and it kind of justifies everything even it doesn't span a lot of time
It's poignant that they can live underground for like 17 years and then literally metamorphose for just a few weeks
What about them?
How lovely
Just found out about cicadas
And if a false reward appears that way it was just really good at being a false reward

A true reward can never become false
when a true reward becomes false it also becomes false in the past
that's what I'm saying though
Only false rewards are false
it was always false
The true reward can never be false
you can't say it was true until the movie definitely ended
so the true reward in front of you could always be false
Exactly
but until the true reward happens, wouldn't you think the false one is true
It was never truly the true reward
If the reward was thought true and it wasn't
By its nature of being
There can only be one true reward
at any time a truer reward could render them false
true rewards are so fragile
Their victory was your true reward
It's the end of the arc
you're so good that you ended their career by losing

Yeah like fear rules most of the time
Love is powerful but it's more about dedication and discipline than it is the other aspects of love
I feel like fear is more powerful and it's not even close
Sometimes when we feel like we have nothing to lose then we lose the fear itself
Feel like a lot of fear = fear of loss  And that might indicate we love something and are afraid to lose it.
Fear of not being loved, scared of death = self love, fear of pain = love of comfort
Like the root of fear is based in love
What if love drives fear
Oooh yeah that's a good way to put it
I think the fact that love HAS to overcome is a statement on the power of fear, and id say they are about equal, with one being stronger depending on your personality
Or is fear more powerful cause it controls
So is love more powerful cause it overcomes
Yeah exactly
Because in a vacuum theres nothing to love, theres no other for that emotion to drive you. In a group love makes you want whats better for them, which can overcome your own fear
Why do you think love is more powerful in groups
Yeah that does
Hmmm, i think evolutionarily fear is probably the most powerful force, in an individual sense. However, in a group sense i think love is more powerful.. idk if that makes sense
Influential i guess
What do you define powerful as
I feel like fear dominates more often, but love is the only thing that can beat it
Fear or Love
What's more powerful
We will succeed even if hell literally breaks loose or the tide rises a bit

There's ascended super saiyan which Vegeta reached and then trunks hit ascended ascended super saiyan.   In the cell arc Goku eventually reached these forms training in the room of spirit and time but decided the speed loss wasn't worth the strength gain.   So he focused on optimizing base super saiyan form which became a form with tamer whitish yellow hair.    And then power creep so Gohan's super saiyan 2 makes all else irrelevant
Fuck did I miss buff trunks discourse
Broly is actually built different
But Broly has really good genetics so it was fine
He turned into that Broly shit
Well this has been expansive
Super saiyan 1.2
Barry I think youre right but Trunks went into like the fake super saiyan 2
This show is bumper cars
https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Saiyan_Second_Grade  Apparently he went "Super Saiyan Second Grade" which is different from Super Saiyan 2
I'm curious i need to look this up now
@Suspicious
Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Edward Cheung to Mr Cell.
I thought he went super saiyan 2 and cell said it made him too slow
Gohan went ss2
he just increased his buffness
Wait trunks didn't go super saiyan 2 i thought
does this mean im cell
Isnt this what cell said when trunks went super saiyan 2
pretty much yeah
In general, body mass correlates to force as an object in motions force correlates with its mass.
assuming you use the same force, having more body mass means nothing lol
its only stronger because youre gonna use more force to move that mass
But if its like a weight in your other hand can you torque in a way to get value
Because whatever youre punching with has some of that mass
If its distributed through your body your punch would just be stronger though
Not automatically, but you could utilize the weight to make your punch stronger
Thats what Im saying
allen you do realize the extra weight itself doesnt just magically make your punch stronger right
If you were in a vacuum you could throw your shoes away and drift toward your target
Cause when you punch for like, a power punch right cross , you throw back your left shoulder, so if you have weight in that hand  you could in theory generate more torgue?
i just read up on this chat and you guys are literally doing twitch chat physics
Unless youre falling into them with your fist
Like I imagine if youre just wearing weighted shoes its hard to get punch value from that
I think the extra weight would work as.long as you can move it to be opposite your punching hand
But I wonder like what distributions of that make it so you need to shift differently to strengthen your punch and what situations in which you cant possibly use the extra weight
So if youre just 10 lbs heavier equally distributed through your body your punch will obviously be stronger without you doing anything
Well, in THEORY maybe? If you thow the weight correctly
If you move your body optimally
Can you make your punch stronger if youre holding a dumbbell in your other hand

The 10 power factors of a punch

Treb has accomplished some incredible feats
The fastest punch was 45mph.
what part of the dumbbell hits you
max punch speed for a boxer is around 25

Who are these average runners
and the average run speed is 28mph
i just looked up the average punch speed is 20mph
can you kick faster than you can punch
Well youre not measuring speed in how many punches it would take to traverse distance though
one leg stride while youre running is worth like at least 3 punches
It would take more time than that surely
Now imagine moving that distance
Just punch right now
Nah actually it makes sense
faster than what
WHAT
Itll be faster lol
Just punch while sprinting tbh
If this is a strictly horizontal punch
I think if you punch someone it doesn't matter how much the dumbell weighs
why
Pretty certain
how certain are you of that
You can punch way faster than you can run
how fast can you run
and have higher breaking points
It sounds pretty weak
Is a 10 mph punch slow
well dumbbells are just more dense
Is your fist just too squishy
Or is it
Why is a 5 lb dumbbell strike stronger than if you punched while being 5 lbs heavier in your hand
how many pounds till lethal head injury
each time
and we just increase the dumbbells weight by a pound
Okay like
lets say the punch is always 10 mph
but if its a dumbbell punch its different
Is the dumbbell being dropped
acceleration of gravity
yeah thats the rate of gravity
Or accelerate
Isnt that how fast things fall
or a punch
overhead strike to the head with a dumbell
what is the scenario
The number 9.81 plays a role but I dont know what role
So to what degree does the damage dealt scale with the weight of the dumbbell
how many mph does it have to be going to do damage
But if they hit you with a 0 lb weight they would have to exert considerably more force in order to effectively be killing you with a punch
i could tap you with a dumbell
what makes it a hit
So if someone hit you in the head with a dumbbell they wouldnt even have to hit you that hard to kill or seriously injure you right
Time only slows when you want it to be the future faster
Any time pressure speeds time up
okay how about when your mom counts to 3
yeah but if the bomb is about to explode you get more time to stop it
If there's a deadline at midnight and it's 11:59 time definitely feels like it's speeding up
Nah that makes time go by faster
and a bomb timer has 10 seconds left

michael jordan is on this chart and not in the corner

Technically if you go out to eat and take food home, someone else made food but only you made it leftovers
like you make leftovers when the food you have becomes leftovers
I guess that might just be making food
what if the leftovers weren't edible before you specifically cooked them
i'd say that making leftovers is not eating food, like once you don't eat it and put it away, you have leftovers but before you had food
But allen is asking if you can intentionally create only leftovers
Yeah that's what i said
If you make something, and a byproduct of making that thing happens to be food that you can eat, you have "created" leftovers without creating a meal
Here's an idea
Uh honestly
You can make appetizers
The title is defined by the state
why isn't that making leftovers
and replicate it down to the atomic level
like say you take a plate of unequivocal leftovers out of the fridge
There is nothing over about it
what if you eat most of it while it's cooking
No
But can you make only leftovers
To intentionally generate leftovers
You can make more than you know you're gonna eat
I had an argument with my friend about whether or not you can make leftovers
How much longer would you have to bake bread before you can say you're making toast from scratch

Okay how about animals
I think the stump doesnt exist until the cut
I chopped down a tree day 2 and the stump is still there
what are these questions even
Do stumps exist until theyre all that remain
But you also cant tap them for too much sap, or else the tree loses too much and cant heal and regrow
you dont tap sugar maples in the summer because the sugar content is way lower
which is literally what maple syrup is

one consequence of this is that the sap will have a very different moisture and nutrient content during the winter than the summer
when they let their leaves fall
trees will pull back nutrients and energy from their leaves back into their branches and trunks
fun fact
they lose all their leave and regrow them once a year
Trees are the endgame tbh
Trees are so high tech
consider all deciduous trees
they have storage in their trunks and roots
But yeah at least horizontally, cutting any of the main stem is really traumatic because the plant then typically needs to reachieve the lost height before growing new leaves
Wait how do they start growing if they need leaves
Who cuts trees across vertically
Yeah I guess o never thought about that
Lots of bleeding
What if you just cut it vertically
Im putting it here for context
Are you asking for a demonstration of visually where

this could mean proper leaves themselves, or leaves high enough that they can compete for sunlight with surrounding foliage
You have to cut enough off that the stored nutrients and water that the tree has may still not be enough to produce viable leaves
This is one of those hybrid science and colloquialisms crossover questions
Do you have to cut low enough that all the branches are gone
Yes plants typically grow from their extremities
Well at what point is a tree a stump though
And cant transport the first up far enough along the trunk
Without leaves they cant take in the latter two
plants need water, carbon, and sunlight to make material
Do branches only grow from the top

If you carve your initials into a tree as a sapling, it wont be dramatically higher up when the tree is much older and taller
Okay thats what I assumed if stumps cant grow but Im still confused
the top part, not even joking
Which part of a tree does the growing lol
They cant make new biomass
no
Do tree stumps grow
Although in both these cases its more like sky
Imagine living in the a trench and having the ocean be space
Yeah it's messed up
and then realizing that there's space space
imagine being an aquatic animal and thinking that the air outside the water is like how we think of space

wat if he was right doe


Idk I just got a really vague email about someone in the U.K. office dying
Were they old

I think someone from my company died from covid
But its also gonna be ongoing for months
Where after a while we should presumably drop it
Its kind of like the New Year thing
How long until we all stop wishing each other to stay safe and well in business emails
You can but thats because your nerve endings are numb
Like, the ground is immune
That's interesting too
if you're dead are you immune
At what gain
I feel like you could keep your hand in an open flame for longer than a normal temperature person no?
Sadly no

american patriotism is a cult
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion
I feel like this treads into brainwashing territory but I agree that in practicality I didn't think about it
But it's not like saying it at 5 really made a difference to us
Like the idea of nations and patriotism is important to know about and experience
I think it's good cause it teaches you about that concept without really being meaningful enough for you to read into
Yeah but I actually look at the lyrics now and its pretty insane
it's pretty horrible objectively but i guess as a kid i didn't think anything about it or what it meant or anything?
https://twitter.com/Mr_RSmash/status/1241351566927503361  I actually thought about this the other day but do you guys ever think about how they made us say this brainwashing shit when we were kids

Parecki is a sub para something. Not a teacher but works with kids
I know theyre like generally old or young so I thought they might just work when needed
i know rick and morty is cringe to reference but that reminds me of the Mr. Meeseeks
Like a lot of our old subs were retired and would sub for a day if asked by a friend
They are normally part time for a district
Do they materialize when needed and disappear after
Do they have desk jobs in education that they can just leave for a day
Are they regular teachers somewhere who get subs when they leave to sub
Do they have day jobs
Like literally
How do substitute teachers work

regularly spaced out bad news
I cant believe biden doesnt plan to do heslthcare for all
crazy how bad news in 2020 is on a concrete schedule that'll climax in november
Crazy how this is all going to happen and then we'll have to vote Biden vs Trump
although covid testing is free

Its like in this time of emergency its finally ok to care about humans
society
Everyone should just pretend they have it
al the politicians slamming ubi and then taking it and watering it down like they came up with it themselves lmao
I wanna get tested but I think I'm better off just assuming I have it
trump is legit considering ubi now like wtf
I read somewhere that trump criticized the drive thru test when korea first implemented it  And then some time later when he officially declared emergency part of his plan was to implement drive thru tests across US
i definitely wish i could get drive thru testing to relieve my anxiety except not drive thru i guess
The next happy meal toy
my family's gonna do that this week i think
i think they have that in the bay now too
south korea drive thru testing is so good
Yeah. Like i dont trust chinas confirmed case count. But i definitely trust the lockdown theyve imposed on their own citizens
Which is aggressively test and quarantine and do it for free
I saw China announced 1 new case yesterday
For democratic nations though they need to follow South Koreas model
Hey all it takes is a competent healthcare system + aggresive and free testing.   Its easier for an authoritarian nation like china to forcibly lockdown its citizens and get the ifection rate under control
And yet here we are and will be
Like at each stage its possible for things to not get worse
Isnt it interesting how simultaneously avoidable and inevitable viral spread is
The US is on pace to be worse than italy now
Bay area is also really bad rn
It's gonna be a really rough time
you shouldt travel
I think the fact that NY understood how inevitable this was going to be yet didn't do anything about it until we got a few cases really screwed us over

wait isnt bay area like a few steps ahead

but at what cost
the world will be cleansed
everyone is stuck at home and the world is in shambles, but on the bright side we have more free time
but at what gain
a lot of people will die
like, lets release this super virus out onto the world
like
mister brightside
Bright sides are worth a little more than silver linings at best
like
i feel like if it at any point looks like theres a bright side the thing is positive
So "but at what gain" would be a negative thing where the bright side actually outweighs the main event
but "at what cost" implies the negative could outweigh the positive
with a silver lining the implication is still that the thing is bad overall
or on the bright side?
like silver linings?
why isn't "but at what gain" a thing
hot coronavirus
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_take
or is it hot because it's hard to handle
so it should be a "fresh from the oven" hot take
fresh perspectives have nothing to do with heat though
actually i guess a cold take can also be new
maybe
like you can have a new but not different take on something
but fresh hot food is fresh cause it's new and fresh perspectives are fresh cause they're different
like if it already existed, it would not be fresh, because it was already there
isn't a fresh perspective itself like fresh hot food
like a fresh perspective and not like fresh hot food
unless you mean fresh like different
i feel like a hot take is more spicy than fresh tho
well they became cold though, not bland
i assumed it was cause it was spicy
idk what my prior assumption was
wait are hot takes hot because they're fresh
Absolutely

i don't know anything about like, the science of pandemics so i have no idea whether that's a good idea or a bad idea. i think we shouldn't do it because even if it does work a lot of innocent people will still die
so the chief scientist wants to strategically infect 60% of the population with covid so that they can't transmit it in the future
The argument behind achieving herd immunity is that doing so would minimize the risk of a coronavirus resurgence similar to the second wave of the Spanish Flu of 1918.
wow it sounds like the uk government was just lazy and bad lmao
Chris Whitty, the UKs chief medical officer for England, said Thursday that holding off on recommending the sort of social distancing other countries have encouraged was a strategic decision, arguing that imposing it too early would cause people to become exhausted and stop participating in it.
The UKs chief science adviser suggested allowing the coronavirus to spread to build immunity.

Jokes on them tho. I do.
They start getting irrational, like I pack underwear when I travel like Im boutta shit myself every day
Also Barold people over prepare when theyre stressed
It's a good thing I stocked up on toilet paper before the coronavirus scare ramped up
it's like if we get trapped in our homes for a while
I also heard there was a rumor that toilet paper is "made of the same material as face masks" but the existence of that rumor itself sounds fake
right i was wondering if like, in emergency situations there are toilet paper life hacks to survive in a post-apocalypse
Like it's not so much a necessity but inconvenient if you don't have it so it's good to stock up
It's one of the supplies you should have in case the stores shut down
like are people shitting extra
so i've been meaning to ask, why is coronavirus making people buy extra toilet paper??
New Mensa*
Mensa
this woman needs to found New
https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/jamie-loftus-the-comedian-who-infiltrated-mensa  "The Mensa saga is more straight-faced than Loftuss usual comedy, much of which replicates the frenzied pace of the Internet and is disturbing and nonsensical to the point of chaos. Like the prankish Nathan Fielder or the strangely sexual Megan Amram, she does elaborately dumb things to make fairly smart points. In 2015, Loftus sold 'Shrek nudes,' naked photos of her body painted green, to raise funds for Planned Parenthood. That same year, she started eating David Foster Wallaces thousand-plus-page novel 'Infinite Jest.' In the video she made documenting the process, she pops a page into her mouth like a potato chip and slurps up a ribbon of the book with spaghetti. At some point, she began putting pages into a blender with apples and using a turkey baster to butt-chug the mixture."  wtf

i have a lot of trouble thinking about last meals after reading a specific death row story
Like from home
Can you study abroad remotely
Thats probably also why people wanna fulfill last meal requests
Landing on the moon
Food wants are so relatable on a primal level
Completing the circuit
The Remington classic
It might just be a want I guess
Onward set it up but then it didnt really deliver
Its so easily executed with food and Birds of Prey did it in the most basic way and it was still satisfying
The full monty
Whats the name of the trope when a character keeps failing to get / do something and then they finally get it at the end
Arc words

Lets keep cooking

One of them is in a cave on another planet
To construct the ultimate burger
We have to find each ingredient in a different place
Imagine asking for a burger from a specific place and just getting some shitty patty
But I think Id rather the person is actually just guilty and someone close to them wants them to be able to have a meal from their tragic backstory before they get executed
Like it could easily have a conspiracy angle where the request is somehow a Prison Break gambit to prove the guys innocence
biden's ears
Phoenix wings
Ill put it in the idea folder
Like it could have almost the exact narrative structure of onward actually
If you're legally dead you can't actually be resuscitated
You know it probably exists but there could be a good story about trying to satisfy someones obscure last meal request
That's a medical myth
what happened to that guy
do you guys remember that guy who had a life sentence and "died" but was revived by paramedics or something and said he can go cause his life sentence is over

Nostalgia, sentiment, simplicity in your final hours
The guy who made his prison stop honoring last meals because he didnt eat his should be sentenced to death again
What complex minds
I like the ones that just order a simple pb&j
That doesnt diminish the irony
Also soda is extremely inexpensive and easy to get
They prefer it over regular coke
Well they like it for the taste
I know but including it in your death row meal is such a power move
Tess only drinks diet coke
A lot of people reeeally like diet coke
The madmen
What struck me most about this article is that 3 people ordered a Diet Coke
The ultimate false transaction
That's a betrayal of trust
Though getting poisoned
Then why does dropping food hurt so much
So eating isn't usually that sacred of an act i think
But most food you shovel into your mouth is kinda just a means to an end
If they just prepared a Thanksgiving feast and were about to eat it thatd be disrespectful
Also I'd be more mad if someone killed me while i was watching a movie
The end of that song is just a bunch of permutations of fatality
If youre at Taco Bell the assassin would just leave
If i'm eating taco bell i'm already disrespecting myself
Andy just reminded me of Mortal Kombat High by Starbomb
Based on what
Cinematality
Barry?
While theyre eating is more disrespectful than most of these things
Copulatilty, aeroplatality, urinatality
While they're at the movies
While they're taking a shower while they're at work
And honestly I dont know if it would be especially bad to kill someone at their wifes funeral
While they're having sex, while they're on an airplane, while they're walking their dog
Those are all specific events though
That wouldnt give me additional guilt
Killing them at their wedding, at their daughter's birthday party, at their wife's funeral
what if you killed someone while they were playing animal crossing :(
Nah that's actually pretty low on the list
doesnt that fundamentally feel more wrong than killing them at most other times
However
Beruka actually
Says who
When someone is eating is supposed to be an ideal time to assassinate them
But giving them a book or show would be too long
For example
Food is sacred
Or you could call it sanctity
I think its an instance of the surprisingly high among of respect humanity puts on eating
It's pretty controllable but also enough for a deathrow inmate
The concept of last meals especially in the context of execution is pretty odd
"I want to eat the chair"

Shes really actually just a hot air balloon
its probably her whole body is only partially effected by gravity
How do you think Sothis float works
like if its basically just controlling the y axis your body is on while gravity effects you regularly for the rest of your body then sitting would be more comfortable
yeah
If you consider it the invisible floor way wouldnt standing in air be just as fatiguing as standing on the ground
I mean if gravity isn't pulling down on any body part in particular then yeah
Compared to standing in the air
Would this be comfortable

if its basically like you can make an invisible floor wherever you want then sitting would be more comfortable
Standing gives full range of motion
depends, where does the float propulsion come from on your body
Standing
If you were floating would sitting be more comfortable than standing

I really hope im not wrong about everything ive just said lol
Like thats of my limited knowledge
I think it is just indicative of the economy, the stocks themselves are correlations
this is what happens when we call up the netherworld by our spells tbh
#Theeconomy
uh it affects a lot of stuff but only for arbitrary reasons. like the stock market is super arbitrary but we base our a major part of our concept of how "the economy" is doing on how the big the number is
to elaborate more on this since i just got home, i was socially a complete wreck in high school and knew almost no one going in to poly. early on i cried a lot because i felt so alone, but overall the amazing thing about college is that all the shitty shit about high school just kind of evaporates
It lowers the number of jobs?
Outside of stuff directly related to the value of stocks are there like "real life" consequences
Twitter had a "don't look at your 401k" article trending which I didn't really understand
This thing really messes up people who are in it for the short term/want access to the money immediately but one could argue those people were playing the wrong sort of game for that type of thing
This happened lol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)
We were due for a recession thats just how it works
Well we have been on an upward trend since the recession to my knowledge I could be wrong
It's the "worst day in over a decade" but idk what to make of that
The big takeaway is that this sorta thing is normal and it's not even close to the worst drop the stock market has had in a day
The pause is only for 15 minutes or so but people think of it as indicative of some crazy shit going down
what a helpful mechanic
People were anticipating that it was gonna do down at some point anyone because things have been on an upward trend for a while
It's going down and it paused bc the stock market has some hidden mechanic where it pauses after it goes down sharp enough
@tess
can anyone explain the state of the stock market in layman's terms
Well, we're glad to have you
I felt that way before I met this friend group tbh. It sucked

Pratfalls
Or should I say
Id rather tripping be brought back purely against hero
And why are they so COMMON
Lol why do crits exist
I hate hero just cause of crits
I fought nairos hero and i couldnt tell what game i was playing
I think when you fight the good ones the neutral becomes cartoony too
At least he looks cartoony and even if he has degenerate moments his neutral itself is normal
I wouldnt have put him in top 5 though
Lol I forgot hero
My hero is gonna make it to allens list
Playing with terry is fun cause both players now have extra win conditions
Also honestly I havent learned his moves and I dont like playing around his random specials that blow you up
While also making it so he cant just mash freely on the ground
Plus I crossed him up while he was mashing and his mash turned around and that irrevocably tilted me lol
I think that keeps the aesthetic of him being brolic on ground but makes it so he can contest platforms
Imo what they could do to buff him would be remove armor on smashes but keep them on tilts, then make his air speed/jump height good but still keep his bad aerials
I thought Ryu getting in was cool and Ken was meh but Terry is a third character who doesnt seem like a smash character and his appearance/animations are obnoxious to me
A big part of it is aesthetic/thematic
I don't necessarily disagree
Can you elaborate more on Ult Terry
I think he should essentially just not have random super armor or w/e and be buffed elsewhere
Because platform camping is so obvious that youre basically sandbagging if you dont do it
What would need to be done for mac to be good but still keep his defining character traits
In tourney specifically
Also I think the vast majority of Mac MUs are unfun for both players
He lost
I remember at SSC two years ago me and paul saw gonz platform camping a mac in a MM by monkey flipping through lylat for 20 minutes
This type of thing only happens when mac is involved
Didnt someone get camped for 30 minutes in a crew battle last weekend
Well the problem is that mac is just too bad to do anything different besides be patient lol
A lot of chars have toxic elements but at high level they usually do impressive stuff
I think in both games Mac is the only smash character where top level play still looks really scrubby
That said i dont feel bad for him
I hated mac a lot in smash 4 but now hes kind of a joke

Why don't you
Allen why do you hate ult mac
We become what we seek to destroy
Is that so uncommon
How do you main one of your top 5 most disliked
When does he say power dunk
I can feel it
No matter where it is
Whenever he says power dunk it hurts me
Is jjabpowerdive too egregious
Who's ulterry hurt you?

Im gonna determine my most disliked smash characters
Terry
Or worse

If she was a Mac main though
Ult Sonic is cool
Im gonna say it
But she's a sonic main 
Allen i hired a prostitute
Thats essentially what I asked
Paying for sex or paying for an egirl
What would you judge me harder for
I can see that... honestly I hope none of us ever have to feel bottom of the barrel lonely
So being single is likely to feel more painful
If you dont have friends and are also single, its easy to place all your social needs into the concept of an SO
I think many single people feel romantic angst but if you have a healthy friend group it mitigates how bad it might feel tremendously
Tbh its hard to fathom how bleak total loneliness is
the loneliest people have the least opportunity to talk about it
Felix Biederman said himself that loneliness is one of the least talked about problems how how prominent it is in American society.
Or I guess its like roughly the same level of shame except without having sex
Nah im with you on that
And I thought wow this somehow sounds more shameful than paying for sex
So like in theory you just pay for your own food
Where you can go and have a romantic dinner with a female entertainer and the club pays for the entertainers meal
On Valentines Day I saw this ad from a nyc steakhouse / strip club
Not really in a how sad way but it makes me just aware of the extent to which people can feel lonely
Aside from gaming I also see some other contexts in which people (mostly guys) have the opportunity to pay for platonic companionship and it makes me feel sad
I think the fact its more mild makes it worse
Its interesting that its like more mild but also more egregious
Also. Gamers suck
Get fucked
Like, you're so unlikable people wont even playnwith you
Lol
Oh, def gaming to me
Oh maybe my question was unclear but I meant which of those things would be perceived as worse
Atleast for me ye becaus sits reinforcing negative thoughts of not being good enough
Would paying a girl for sex or to play games with you do more social damage to you
I cant remember it because I forgot why people think the earth is flat
It was a response to one of the points lol
Somewhere in the middle
Stupid but valid or completely stupid
I came up with a super stupid comeback to flat earthers but I for the life of me cant remember it

Omg its most powerful when you had no idea that someone saved something of yours or related to you and then they reveal it
If you hold on to the good times do they ever really end
Evidence of a time once happy
It can be so beautiful and moving when people consciously make a point of holding onto something
Yeah we save things pretty inefficiently
Like there are a lot of things and memories we go out of our way to save despite consciously knowing how unlikely we are to ever revisit it, but that doesnt mean it was in vain, because saving something can be primarily a signifier of appreciation in the present
I think the sentimental value of saving things is interesting
That was sick

Well here's the thing. Apparently boilers made after a certain point didn't last as long as those made before it because of planned obsolescence being more profitable than long-lasting boilers. the same was true of lightbulbs too i think. i've been meaning to watch a documentary on planned obsolescence to learn the details

I've been to a dick museum before and whale dicks are definitely extraterrestrial appendages
Every time i learn more about the circumstances of confusing animals for seamonsters it gets funnier i swear
Well this is where many of our deep sea monster stories come from,because as it turns out many of these drawings may have depicted large tentacled and alienesque appendages emerging from the water giving belief to something larger and more sinister lurking beneath.... however in many cases it was really just whale dicks. Whales often mate in threes so while one male was busy with the female the other male just pops his dick out of the water while swimming around waiting his turn.
idk where to send this but the idea that crazy tentacle sea monsters are actually renditions of whale dicks from before photography existed is kind of brain expansion
You sent an attachment.
I'd still take Cuphead out lol
I guess what I thought of it as is an amount of games where at least one is someone's favorite

Does natural talent factor
So even if one game is more complex and has more room for skill, if it has substantial rng, its less skill based?
Like hitting a target with a gun versus a bow?
People master things at such different speeds
I suppose when you compare how skill-based things are, youre comparing the based part, not the skill
How do you measure time to master
If there are 2 games that have the same endgame level of skill, but one of them takes twice as long to master, is it more skill-based or the same
Like it shouldnt be purely mental? There are mental skills but when people say something is skill-based it seems to always mean physical/tangible skill
Does a skill just mean if you practice it you can get better at it, and with a weak physical requirement
As a result answering your question becomes very difficult
He mentioned that Smash is based around an exclusionary ruleset, i.e. the rules were created based on what we DON'T think ought to be rewarded (random item play, stage hazard play)
Also I meant determining, not deterring
The issue may be that skill itself is incredibly vague
Rishi made a good video about this subject
Besides brawl
Like, we can evaluate whether something requires/rewards skill but I dont know where you would begin in deterring the most skill-based game
How come the upper boundary of skill-based games and activities is so nebulous

I think its a shortcut if its less distance but most people dont take it either because its obscure or just suboptimal
Impeccable
Andy drew a dick and balls covering a road and said imagine this is a shortcut
And the main path is a regular road
Imagine those green things are trees
B. If you put yellow lines on the shortcut does it stop being a shortcut
A. Is this not obvious
See but like

Even if it takes longer it can be a shortcut
Also shortcuts depend on distance, not time
They have to be allowed some access to information or else everything would be a shortcut
It's a more obscure route that's faster
Well new people wouldnt know the comparative speed of any route if theyre just eyeballing it
What makes something a shortcut and not just another path
Google maps would tell them
But that was also the basis of my original question
But new people wouldn't
Google maps knows some shortcuts
Just different paths
But i wouldn't say it tells you shortcuts
Google maps takes traffic into account
Would google maps have to not know it
Also, what level of knowledge / access to information does the new person have
Would it still be a shortcut then in the absence of new people
Yeah but if it's not obvious to a new person
But I feel there are situations in which everyone takes the shortcut
like mario kart shortcuts
id say if it's not immediately obvious to a new person
I guess even if everyone knows it, its still a shortcut if the majority of people dont use it
Do over 50% of people have to use it or know if it
When it crosses a certain threshold of how known it is?
At what point does a shortcut just become the way

Sorry
Dang and it's so hard to find an out of the person's not interesting
Creating situations in which you have to trade volleys of responses about your interest, their interest, and the weather
Which is that if youre a bit shy or awkward with the opposite sex / the sex youre attracted to, or even if its just someone you dont know well, you feel a bit more alert / pressured to be polite in a conversation and that can lead to explicitly replying to each thing even if its clunky
How many conversations do i comprise
I have a theory
Probably some hormone reacting to a pheromone or something
Nah I feel that
Either way its kinda funny when a chat attains that structure
Not sure if theres any actual correlation
And it can go past 2 lol
Same actually
And they both respond to me and answer the question, and then there are 2 lines in play at once
Wait i get that
But with girls I get into a lot of situations where its like I say my thing and then ask about them
Like usually with guys we talk about one thing at a time wherever the conversation goes
Cause i think yes but wanna check
What do you mean by that
Does anyone have experience with this
I feel like Im much more likely to get into multiple conversations at once with girls than with guys

Did they come up with this word themselves

The killer of no nut November
Tbh this is super human centrict but that reminds me of when you masturbate cause youre bored
that's bad AI
there's also stuff like dogs humping random objects which is kind of outside sex for fun or procreation
Nah, thats just weird
I think.you need a central nervous system to be horny
Justin if a person really wants to have sex purely to procreate, is that horny
like they don't resist or anything and it happens all the time
do trees experience horniness
Ah, was thinking the extent to which its beyond for survival of species
the way I look at it is the extent to which it's contained
there are various ways to measure horniness I suppose
I think so?
like, didn't ducks develop anti rape vaginas
and if a human in that situation did that, it would be peak human horniness
Imo one is like, this is to keep our species alive the other is "im just horny"
imo animals are hornier because in many situations they would basically never resist / want to resist trying to get sex
also why does whether it's for "fun"/reproduction affect the horniness of the action
Goals
What about bonobos? Almost all social interaction amongst them is sexual in nature
like if you go to a sauna
There's a lot of things we would do because we want to and they feel good, but they aren't really fun
Fun requires more than just doing it outside of survival, it needs a certain degree of amusement
There's lots of evidence of young mammals having fun
One reason why I think it's a human thing is that people very rarely talk about animals having fun, and by far the most common nonhuman context is dogs in relation to human interactions/framing
Doing things outside of survival needs
or, what is fun
but fun to me feels like a human concept
I feel like playing/enjoying things is relatively widespread
do they though

Dogs have fun
is fun a human construct
does every gay animal have sex for fun
Flapple?

damn I just remembered a cataclysmic sex tifu that I repressed but I can't tell if it was driven by horniness or a lack of it
Were the only 2 that have sex for fun
I think dolphins and humans have to be top 2
Is the species that has the most sex the horniest
Wouldnt horniness just be how much you cuck/want to
how does that factor into the horniness equation
Actually they produce 200x more eggs per sexual encounter so that data might be skewed
Ants?
bottom 5 tbh
Are humans top 5% horny
Top 1% horny
Do animals have a range or are they either 0% or 100%
well it's comparing against the rest of the population, not how horny you are out of 100
Or does it go beyond
Is that what causes rape
What does 100% horny look like
I probably achieved both the top 10% and bottom 10% during nnn
If you consider the horniness of all guys/people in the world, it's plausible
well the entirety of okc could be more horny than the average guy/person, it would only be impossible if they were comparing against the rest of okc
which is the only place where it's visible i guess
yea i can understand why a guy would feel like that but it's actually like literally every guy on okc lmao
I'm not horny but
to the point where I'd accept anyone who makes the claim as most likely above average
I mean I feel like a substantial number of guys downplay horniness
like it's just not mathematically possible but they're not aware
like how almost 100% of guys on dating apps say they're above average horny
i guess that just means each of those ppl think they're the only one who knows
But a lot of people are saying it
Yeah he had a good showing recently
Sonic is low key good apparently
The range of movies that you can correctly place in the "low key" claim category is very small
but people also say Detective Pikachu or whoever is low key top 5 and that's also just incorrect
Yeah the acting was amazing
if you say like Joker is low key top 5 you imply it's some kind of hidden truth when it simply is not
It has less meaning just because "on the down low" is said less, especially in cases when it doesn't make sense
Between you and me
Not for nothin
On the down low
Do you think it has less or more meaning than saying
People say it unnecessarily extremely often
actually I think low key has also lost meaning
And high key is used a lot for excitement/good things
I feel like low key is said with a more serious tone
So idk if we're the best to explain it
We also don't really have a lot of first hand experience with using the terms
but like you tell someone it's highkey and you show everyone else
Like, there's an inherent tension if you say it's low key, but you just say high key things
yeah but if you just say the thing you're also not hiding it
I feel like people say so instead of high key
i feel like highkey means you feel it so much, you're not afraid to hide it at all and want to show everyone
Where you're using it to go past the established phrase, even if it technically invalidates the original point
If your friend told you they were low key mad that's confidential and probably bad if everyone knew
High key adds meaning but in the same way saying "I could care less" does
Which could be more important
Low key adds a bit of secrecy
high key should only mean it's not on the down low
but low key doesn't even modify the severity of the statement
I'm high key mad
I'm mad
or "clearly"
it's like "very"
i'd say so
does high key add any meaning to a statement
my nickname was lewis for a while

Oh I have one
It's like what's your korean name, or pokemon name
oh

can what
You're technically the only one who can
Can you have a nickname if Nick is your name
Im fundamentally opposed to name extension humor
Wendy Orlean Koopa
where's paultena
Also these are the lamest nicknames
these nicknames are so bad
Like what if his name is just Terrence

I thought about this because of this tweet
but then it's not a nickname
yea i feel like someone has definitely jokingly called andy andrew before
Additionally what happens to the status of your nickname if you legally change your name to your nickname
Or if someone likes giving random nicknames to people, but unknowingly nicknamed you your actual name
For example if you go by a short version of your name, but one of your friends says the full name
Can your nickname be your actual name
hey I'm actually a romantic

Wym
like tweek was basically the start of it
wait this nairo run makes no sense
That run made me sad
I saw that tear Chris

Double elim the chatacter from existence
you could double eliminate g&w
But double elimming zero is more than anything you could do in this game imo
I dont think so
leo could probably double eliminate himself if possible
No you just tech when you hit the wall
TECHNICALLY no. But the frames move slower
see nairo has an unfair advantage because he got to beat the best player lol
is the tech lockout stretched out
like in the case of teching is the window stretched out
Di does not get effected tho
For techs
How does that work
They slow down so it technically gives you more time
what about smash con 2019 wii u when I beat xj-9 and fran and then void dqed against me
Also dramatic finishes dont effect inputs
My dude went to losers and had to fight sinji
I slept
Thats the best run free
Nairos run was the best by far yall sleep
Wait actually
Teching
the dramatic finish shouldn't happen on spikes
Smash con 2017:  Nairo beat Sinji, komorokiri, tweek, void, shoyo james, wadi, Mr. R, Leo, Zero, Zero
Like does it affect di or sdi or teaching
Yes and its annoying as shit LOL
Does that affect inputs
And the game does a slow mo
when a strong hit lands
Quick smash question
Rn, leo is more top heavy, but i think zero is deeper. With maister x2, i think leo might edge it out
I think clearly we can see nobody knows the tournaments or years lol
From the top to the bottom for both runs Tweek>Dabuz>Nairo>Zackray>Samsora>Tea>Wizzt>Salem  Nairo>Dabuz>Ally>Esam>Anti>MVD>Zenyou>Wizzrobe>Rayquaza>Manny
wait why does everyone know specific tournaments and years and matches
Wait 2017?
Leo beat Salem, Dark Wizzy, Samsora, Nairo, zackray, Dabuz, Tea and Tweek
Thats wild
Okay Zero beat MVD Manny Wizzrobe Ally ESAM Zenyou Rayquaza Anti Dabuz Nairo
Nairo smash con 2016
5
4?
Which bighouse was the one with a wild zero run?
first of all big house 3 was in 2013
Mine are better
Big House 3 Zero
is Leo's losers run today the best one in smash

cause it's not a fuel
like i feel like that wouldn't lead to fuel
or polystyrene
oh wait it is chlorofluorocarbons
actually bunny would have been a possible choice otherwise since there's dust bunnies, they could eat vegetables in greenhouses including iceberg lettuce
I also couldn't go for anything dust bunny related because of easter
I tried to think of something dust-related that could damage the atmosphere but I felt like if I went anywhere environmental harm fuel would most likely be picked
I love that he's voiced by the guy who does Okuyasu in JoJo
like the stuff that gets emitted when styrofoam breaks or decomposes
hmm wait it's not a dust, but something is that
and fuck Caiman
I wanna go to the gym with Noi
It's gory as fuck but I like it
i don't think that picks up those two but maybe

the war for snake's ass will go on until the end of time

Idk if the war only never ended for me in smash 4 when Snake was gone or if that was the only time the war ended
same with me and Isaac
Me when Waluigi was excluded from being a character for 5 different smash games
i mean that's how a lot of soldiers with ptsd put it. "the war never ended"
They just become new wars
Old wars never end

What a powerful comparison in the context of pronouncing pwn
btw i know "pone" won the war of how "pwn" is pronounced but i'm like the "holdout japanese" who never heard the war was over because it's closer in spelling to "pawn" so i will always fight for it to be pronounced "pawn"
pwning is a type of cybersecurity exploit

There could have been no luck involved in that, which would make his luck purely positive, although that could also not be luck

I would say bad luck

I could offer that to someone right now
Immunity to bullets or perfect knowledge of how much time to microwave things for
Like would you rather be able to control your hair or not say you too when your server says enjoy your meal
Levitation is a low grade enough power for that tradeoff tho haha
Levitate, i dont call people
Would you rather be able to levitate or never start speaking at the same time as the person youre on the phone with
My dude really rolled in to fsmash


hmmmmm i see
but the feeling of depression is so complicated
well i mean other than the neuroscience of it, that seems to make sense
it's deceptively complicated
like depression (the mental illness not the economic thing) is such a complicated concept for me to parse
this is kinda poetic in a sense
sorry misclick
depression 
The most elaborate character in the jy kanji list is the 29-stroke , meaning "depression".

this is one kanji and it means "the appearance of a dragon in flight"

It looks easier than that type of noodle one
LMAO
and it means verbose LMAO
wait wikipedia said some guy said this is the most complex chinese char

probably nsfw btw
i dunno where to post this but i had to read this for a class and it was genuinely interesting to me so yall might find it interesting too https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/08/10/learning-to-speak-lingerie
jesus christ my head SPIN
yo that's simplified?????

wow this character needs to be written in giant font on wikipedia lmao
the sheer information

Honestly, fuck writing. Fuck talking, just put an antennae on my neck and let me absorb and broadcast psychic frequencies to communicate
but also one character is way more info i guess
yea i definitely think a lot about if chinese written language affects like reading speed or comprehension cause in english, you read with word shapes and that exists way less in chinese
Right but English has capital letters from the start which was the point of the bolding or italicizing
but i mean you don't do bold and italics in english for that either like it's only typed
yea it's probably over
but then how would you do it in print, outside of computers or typewriters
work*
Yeah that'd word
i think they have bold tho and maybe italics
Right like isn't Chinese writing just unique characters for every word?
they just don't have uppercase
i mean i think it's just impossible
I don't know anything about writing in Chinese characters, how would it work?
I just need to know if something is a name lol
capitals are so much better for reading faster and comprehension
i been sayin
Chinese needs capitals

Like if you have to call your teacher Master Smith that should be fine
For now
I feel like of existing options master might legitimately be the best option even though its masculine-leaning
We could adopt -san to not have to make a new term viable
Yeah there are already some words like captain but their general applicability is dubious
Chief
Mir
Sam
Should there be a neutral honorific in English
A Warrior King
A King
I accidentally hit  before submitting my two step verification code but it still worked
I guarantee no tournament has ever ended at 7 pm est in any time zone
I retroactively think it's fake
My dude, how am I looking like calling dudes names Bepsi and ebo my rivals
I got 9th
I thought it was real but I also appreciate the shitpost hustle
Not the really good players but the good ones
Mad good players were on that shit right away
Im concerned Im going to get cancelled or something
I still can't tell
I couldnt tell at first either
I cant tell who thinks this is serious and who thinks its fake
Was the tweet time supposed to be the giveaway factor
Bepsi a big win
I hope this gets me considered for PR
Me too
I always knew you could do it 
Congrats!
Are people liking because its a shitpost or because they think its real

"oh, cool thanks i guess"
"oh can i see the murder weapon? This knife was purchased by john smith at weapons and co on september 3rd!"
"We solved the case and got the killer!"
like
and we realized hes basically useless cause he can only trace a clue back after the case has been solved
he only does macro solving
my friend and i made up a character called the intective
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCnbgXyU09c
it wasnt random if it helped

if it was actually just a random apple but you thought it was a clue, coincidentally leading you to solve the crime, was it a clue after all


I've failed sj during black history month. I'm going to Hell
Its brick obama
I'm blind
Wait that's not obama
And yet solving the crime is somewhat dependent on finding clues
Clearly I'm Barry Obama
You cant definitively say whether or not its a clue until you determine whether or not its related to the crime
Like if theres an apple at a crime scene
The issue is that their validity is so amorphous and goal oriented
The robot has bullet holes in it
But the knife is buried in the fish bowl
Hey look this knife has blood on it next to this dead robot
Or both
Or is there detected conclusion supposed to be not obvious
Are clues supposed to be not obvious

isn't the notion of clues so vague
The detectives
The spies
The ninja ninjas of the ninja show
Kishimoto went so hard with kakashi and itachi for no reason
but who's gonna protect you from it
yeah I guess the wall is supposed to protect you from stuff
is it the tension with the inherent immobility of walls
You cannot stop the one thing meant to stop anything
The sense of pure helplessness
what makes demonic walls so scary
And he's surprised but still trying to reason with it
As soon as you said that i imagined the wall moving towards him
which one is barry

talking to Barry about his opinions on Naruto
I have the high ground
Don't try and type up some fuckshit arguing about hitachi being cooler than itachi sj
That guy fucks
Now hitachi
Fuck itachi
It's true
Who
Itachi: Somehow NOT the Coolest Akatuski, more at 7
someone tried to sell me something and i had to battle them
Shes so cool
Nah Kisame is 2nd
I liked the paper lady
Art is a blast
I mean ok deidara is maybe close
It's not even close
The coolest akatsuki even
Except sasori is cool
These people are like Sasori from Naruto when he opens his chest and summons 100 puppets
There's always a string or 100 attached
But this explains the other Bezos problem p well

Not to re-bring up stuff from yesterday
But I have yet 2 meet 1 man that can outsmart boolet

Feel like a mental breakdown is when you lose a battle with yourself
Uh I'm not sure which I prefer
Define it as you like
Does a mental breakdown count as a battle with myself
When was the last time you were in a battle irl
Some coffee shot
better JoJo character
Good rapper 
Wtf LOOOL
Vanilla ice
but tea isn't a bean
wait that's actually really close lmao
Ice T
One day, a bean fell in love with some water. The water said they could get married if the bean became used as a flavoring agent. The bean replied that they could get married only if they lived in a colder climate. They agreed and had a baby who happened to be a good rapper. What did they name their baby?


Only if they've been PICKLED
I just think NYU doesnt know fungi is not a veggie
But I feel like it is fungi
It cant be fungi because veggie
Cucumber?

Thats such a good deal wtf
Waiiiit

u right
Its time to start spy family regardless
time to start spy family i guess
Wasnt that the last chapter of spy x family
*in the arms of an angel starts playing* millions of furry friends sit in cages waiting for you to seize the means of production
it's actually insane
do you know how many dogs die to cops each year
capitalism is anti dog
omg
just say universal healthcare applies to dogs
Its a tough line to walk
I wish there was some clear middleground to explaining this stuff to the general populace between the barrage of philosophical and theoretical terms and look you want actual healthcare right
"In modern usage, late capitalism often refers to a new mix of high-tech advances, the concentration of (speculative) financial capital, Post-Fordism, and a growing gap between rich and poor" also from the wikipedia article
Bet
basically capitalism has been getting more and more fucked up since 1940
I just woke up so, explain like im 5?
Late capitalism, or Late-stage capitalism, is a term first used in print by German economist Werner Sombart around the turn of the 20th century.[1] Since 2016, the term has been used in the United States and Canada to refer to perceived absurdities, crises, injustices, and inequality created by modern business development.[citation needed]  Later capitalism refers to the historical epoch since 1940, including the PostWorld War II economic expansion called the golden age of capitalism. The expression already existed for a long time in continental Europe, before it gained currency in the English-speaking world through the English translation of Ernest Mandel's book Late Capitalism, published in 1975.  The German original edition of Mandel's work was subtitled "an attempt at an explanation", meaning that Mandel tried to provide an orthodox Marxist explanation of the post-war epoch in terms of Marx's theory of capitalism. Mandel suggested that important qualitative changes occurred within the capitalist system during and after World War II and that there are limits to capitalist development.
I truly dont known
Blastoise Capitalsim
Third evolution
I get its later stages but what does it consist of
(Idk what that shit means I assume it means like techno capitalism but Im also an imbecile)
Its capitalism but at bedtime
Ok, i keep hearing "late stage capitalism" and idk exactly what it means
FB is second only to like your social security number as a means of identifying your personhood
Like yeah using messenger supports the regime but also messenger is systematically ingrained into how everyone here communicates
Yeah I mean also one of the symptoms of like late stage capitalism is tech giants monopolizing every aspect of what we consume
See Im supporting now so I can call back to this moment when needed to boost my score
I cant wait for my Facebook score to be sent to jobs 20 years from now. my slate is clean. All hail daddy zuck
So now he has to choose to be negligible in his support of capitalism (to the point of being .0000000000000000001% of the support.) Or not talking to his friends
Lets go systems harbored by the users
Exactly. Same. So say barry wants to talk to us, im not going to change to discord cause i fucking hate it
And am a fan of capitalism
Yes because I love messenger
But you know as well as we do, a transition to discord is HARD, we tried it with just smash LOL
There are alternatives too
There is also discord lel
I would mention it here but Facebook has been known to ban accounts/ hide messages when talking about its direct competition
Debatable, there are websites that dont data track
I mean, so are all forms of communication
But like messenger is directly fueling capitalism
The implication is the same, especially when this is the most common and most uzed form of conversation
Like giving up hearthstone because blizzard is crazy is a bit different
Not anything connected, just messenger
This is inherently a terrible argument if only because it implies to have any opinion on politics you have to be able to give up anything connected at the drop of a dime
And no I have never been on 4chan
>Hates capitalism >Uses Messenger
The american school systemnis already a shit show and as elitist and stressful as most asian and european systems are they still are strictly better lol

Im gonna go do one of the two things Im good at, and as to what thing that is: Ill let history be the judge of that
And with that I go to sleep
Was it wrong to nuke the Japanese? Should the civil war have happened? But what if imperialism good?
Speaking of the US education system they need to stop asking kids to write dumbass essays about like totally amoral areas in US history
That movie did more for teaching history than the entire US education system
National Treasure is still a national treasure in my eyes
Hes done some good stuff
Oh damn
I don't know. I've never seen any of his movies
It bewilders me and bothers me
Why is Nic Cage still seen as a bad actor
Absolutely
Of significantly diminished importance
Hey can I shift to something I wanna rant about
Yeah my society didnt know how to make boats but they knew how to make fighter jets
Humanity is a tech skill fiend
Yeah but that's literally where this whole thing started. The people at the top aren't just misguided. They are openly malicious and will say literally anything to protect their interests. No systemic change can occur without confronting the handful of people who benefit and perpetuate it.
We've lost touch of the simple shit but we can do wildly amazing scientific feats
I think thats the bullshit CNN says bc theyre scared of jewish socialist man to take away their money
The only time Ive ever felt optimistic about the course of human history was while playing civ today I advanced scientific progress in Australia enough to the point that I had Giant Death Robots liberating countries from tyranny every 5 years
Anyone who sees Bloomberg as more of a democratic candidate than Sanders has a legume for a brain
the only true democracy is one that explicitly excludes capital from the process
liberal democracy is a sham and no one has an excuse to think otherwise when bloomberg runs as a democrat despite being a REPUBLICAN WHO SUPPORTED GEORGE BUSH AND DOESN'T GET SHIT FOR IT while Sanders CONSTANTLY GETS SHIT FOR "NOT BEING A DEMOCRAT"
monarchy to capitalism*  capitalism to communism*
"Steven the Lesbian in 'STRAIGHT UP DYKIN''"
IN  THE ARENA OF COURSE
guy*
THAT CARTOON IS STILL SO GOOD
The change from monarchy to democaracy when democracy exists is much differen than the change from Democracy to communism when communism doesnt
reminds me of the happy harry cartoon "Steven the Lesbian" where some shitty straight gay just goes to a lesbian bar and insists he's a lesbian
If we go back to the point of Im afraid to be angry at the grub hub customer service rep
Important distinction but it means the same thing
Ok when I say nothing I can do about it what I mean is nothing I will do about it
like we got rid of monarchies even tho personality variance existed
Here you come upon the important fact that every revolutionary opinion draws part of its strength from a secret conviction that nothing can be changed..  George Orwell
I do love women
i think it does if you're a lesbian
Psychologically personality stays roughly similar unless forced to be different if im not mistaken
Hold onto that
Like the world changes and so do we
4.5 years ago I thought wearing beanies and flannel every day would get me laid
i mean there's been stuff in the past where big stuff got overhauled and systems changed
Like my tastebuds change every 7 years
Nah cuz were 20-27
In which case, do we have to accept that due to personality type variance we are inherently stuck in the status quo? Or can all of personality be changed in order to overhall that without using the systems in place
Its why people scream at the top of their lungs when theyre locked in somewhere
Im infinitely more likely to vocalize my issues about something when I know theres nothing I can do about it
I think thats a totally reasonable and valid assertion
So does this relate to personality type i guess? Cause in my experience, the people who are most up in arms about this are the people who cant (or wont, but normally cant) do as much. (Def not trying to take shots at anyone, just making an observation for feedback)
I think thats totally valid to recognize but thats what Im tryna say. Like I dont need people telling me if not now when cuz I know thats the next logical step of things but also wtf am I gonna do when Im afraid to go outside and go to 7-11
where's edelgard
edelgard would start a revolution
And the only difference is that Im better at both jerking off and fighting games
that's the question at the center of my neurosis. i scream and yell about this stuff on the internet but i'm terrified of canvassing or phonebanking
But Im also saying that shaking my peers down asking them what are you doing, the world is on fire isnt doing anything for me because theyre often doing what Im doing and what Im doing is jacking off and playing fighting games
Fair enough, but even for poor people, statistically speaking they are significantly less likely now
yea i feel like the core discussion is what are we gonna do about it
Like Im not saying capitalism isnt the cause of global decay cuz it is
good thing we got poor ppl to get shipped off to war instead
Tho also, dont think hes wrong lol
Im talking from a "am i going to be shipped off to war perspective"
Like, i think people severely underestimste how much psychopaths have to keep other people happy in order to maximize their own position
all i can hope for is being like a graphic designer for like political propaganda and that's not very impactful
justin i love you but pls don't give me that steven pinker shit  https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/episode-58-the-neoliberal-optimism-industry
Thats what i mean
yea idk what i can do as an individual
Like Im not throwing my hands up Im literally doing the things Im always doing cuz the most I can see myself doing about this problem is talking the talk

And id put money on that being the fact that every nation (bar a couple) that has relevance in international politics has to not start a war to stay in power
There is no escape
Unless we do eugenics but then we would all be dodo through the basis of our existence
perfect weather for a revolution
Capitalism is bad but people are also dodo that shit is never gonna end
I swear to god this system is going to be the end of human civilization
Statistically speaking, the world is in its most peaceful time ever rn
like... if now isn't the time to fucking end capitlism... FUCKING WHEN? THE PLANET'S BURNING DOWN, PEDOPHILES ARE BEING KILLED IN THEIR CELLS TO PREVENT THEIR BUDDIES FROM BEING IMPLICATED, WE ALMOST WENT TO WAR WITH IRAN WITHIN A WEEK OF THE DECADE STARTING!?!?!?!?!?
I mean people under feudalism werent in an Information Age where some NSA ghoul can make my phone explode if I type something Im wrong
it's hard for me to imagine any other way to solve climate change in time cause it has to be solved instantly and it's so big
we need to make a revolution discord
Woke wasnt an issue we could even have until 25 years ago
I mean people thought the same about feudalism dawg
Same but we shouldn't throw our hands up and say "Let's just try and make capitalism be woke" when it has refused to be woke for 200+ YEARS
So we might as well find ways to not burn the earth while we are here
I more importantly mean, noone will see capitalism end until the second coming of christ
m a r x i s t   r e v o l u t i o n
i also think if all people died, it'd be way chiller and the planet will live
Which I unfortunately agree with
I think Justin means I wont see capitalism end in my lifetime
Id argue it isnt as the fact that consumerism is already a thing will mean people will want it
Consumerism is inherent to capitalism. and before you say capitalism is human nature, people said the divine right of kings was human nature so i won't fucking have it
what if the way around is marxist revolution 
100% this
Consumerism is an inherent cancer. But it will never not be a thing at this point, so i feel at this point we have to find a wayb work around
while mainland chinese-owned in HK have been fucking ransacked
Nah that sounds horrible
EX My Ex
Yaseen you just reminded me that EX anything is instant comedy
Even though no fucking hong kong protestors begging for colonialism back got killed
it very rarely gets media attention or gets big enough to affect us at all
hmm yea that's true
So we don't hear about it as opposed to Hong Kong
that's not as sexy as CHINA BAD 1984!!!
Andy Hamilton
The problem is
There's already violent revolt against neoliberalism all over the world
In this given world, let me be clear
Alright the people who made me buy a metal straw and then EX carbon emissioned the planet is actually evil
I think seizing the power of production is inherently a terrible idea
like i wish the hk protest got worldwide
and i guess it sort of does but doesn't get big
i REALLY want a violent revolution to start
Bro how fucked is it that during the great revolution where Amazon is crumbling to its knees, we still have fucking Facebook live
it's about seizing power and using it to forcefully dismantle and restructure our economy
Not to bloat this conversation too much but I very much understand not wanting to divorce worries about late capitalism from climate change Because half the reasons oil/coal companies can pollute the world freely is they spend their endless amounts of money to pay off politicians stopping their regulation
i personally feel like if we don't marxist revolution, we're all just gonna die so eh
it's about seizing wealth and the means of producing wealth
yea idk like my personal stance is that i'm not strong enough of a person to like be an organizer or be involved in a big revolution but i sure hope we wheel some guillotines out unironically and then i can post the videos on fb
it's not just about destroying
Cause like, say you burn down amazon, and shatter microsoft.  You still have mass consumerism, leading to the burning down of the actual amazon
It's not enough to plant trees. and bernie sanders is just one social democrat. not even a real socialist
Honestly none of these politicians give 2 shits about me i might as well focus on getting money and being a decent human been
Imma just vote bernie and plant trees mang idk
nah cause it wouldn't fix anything
Idk how many times me and barry have debated marxism LOL
like i legit think about ehhh if i had the death note, would i even kill jeff bezos
my interpretation of all of it is that the conclusion is marxist revolution
And then the next richest will do the same
Eat the rich who are putting this shit in the air
I feel like a lot of times people make the end game of being mad at climate change being mad at capitalism which then detracts and convolutes an issue. If that makes sense.  Like, we are mad then world is on fire, but then the conclusion is "eat the rich" when that wouldnt change anything per se?
i mean online rage doesn't get anyone anywhere i guess
It just feels this way a lot of the time from what I read
i also don't think it's a choice between like being angry at billionaires in the public eye vs actually doing things
And again, systemic change can't be enacted if people who wield incomprehensible amount of power over the economy and politics are in the way
Also the value judgement of saying theyre evil or not doesnt mean anything cuz well never interact with them or even interact with a person 2 degrees of them
I don't direct my anger directly at one billionaire. I use Bezos as a face for all of them. As a class, they're evil
That came out bad
Its why I dont get the like specific emphasis of Mark Zuckerberg as the universal evil when theres 500 trillion steps that put him to where he is
Giants are built by hundreds of thousands of millions of ants, and i dont think thats ALWAYS bad, despite often being so.
Rather than the systemic issues that create these kinds of people
Like if I direct my anger at Jeff bezos over the next billionaire of the day I accomplished nothing
these people are giants and should held responsible
My whole job is to see how close you can be to the line without crossing it
At the end of the day we're ants
I mean, by that theory so ak i for doing audit
Nah I agree with that
Idk what the word is but like misdirection
For their own benefit
They're perpetrating the system being fucked
Dont mean to
I also think directing your anger at a person over a system lets you like
And yaseen correct me if thats putting words in your mouth
What i think my point is is, much like yaseens point, is that the system is fucked but that doesnt mean the people who benefit from the system are evil
I def think that the system is flawed and we need to fix tax cuts and whatnot, but I can't get with personally attacking these people because I have bigger and better things I could do by myself to make an impact on me and those around me. I understand that is inherently self centered but i dont care
Again, one more reason to never fucking pursue that position in the world in the first place
None of what they're doing is "an accident" like that. They know what they're doing
Also. Dont get me started on shareholders suing you for doing the right thing LOL
Mb typo
O
You cant expect people to know the exact outcome of every action imo
Like Bill Gates can buy the NFL 25 times and not not be a billionaire
I cant spell that shit either dw
Billionare is like wtf
So incomprehensible I spelled it wrong
Magnitude of like 100
Yeah being a millionaire just means ur cheap af LOL
A key thing here, is that with that kind of money you literally have no excuse for doing anything evil. All the world's power and information is at their fingertips. They have no excuses for "not knowing better"
Yeah billionairism is an incimprehsenibke amount of wealth
Facts
also millionaires and billionaires are so different
It's so easy to just say we'd fix everything lol
Like I think we literally cannot measure how we would act
The thing is this happens to so many people of wealth
I dont think being a millionaire is a sign of a moral failure tho
i mean i feel like you could argue that being a billionaire is inherently evil regardless of how you got the money cause like you're hoarding all this money
I think the evil part (and I use evil somewhat loosely and hyperbolically) is the fact that with that amount of wealth you have the power and influence to holistically shape the world for the better and everyday youre not explicitly doing that like what are you doing
They provide services to ICE and have their hands in the republican party cookie jar. they're evil
As someone who quite literally has sat in rooms with millionaires and the kids of millionaires, i think youre forgetting they are human too here and most people arent psychopaths innthis field
My point is that these issues are more to do with the system than the people themselves and I really dont know what I would do being in those positions
Ok but when we talk about say, microsoft, that got the size it is by quite literally being better to the point of being a monopoly. Thats just unethical, not evil.
no, they're literal unfeeling insects who would toss the rest of humanity in a wheat thresher if someone showed them an excel spreadsheet that told them they'd make a cent on it.
to just say "unethical" or "exploitative" is a euphemism. like we just need to slap them on the wrist with a fine or put them in prison for 5 years under our legal system and everything will be ok
like for exmaple when we talk about pharmaceutical companies manufacturing the opioid crisis we're not talking about a drug dealer taking advantage of an addict, we're talking about manufacturing a widespread of health crisis of drug addiction to line their own pockets
that's the key thing here
it's unethical and exploitative at such a massive scale that it's impossible to call it anything other than pure evil
Evil might be a poor word, but unethical and exploitative both fit
it's never $10 billion of "his" "hard earned" dollars. no one fucking "earns" the amount of money bezos has to his name. there's always some loophole they abuse (in amazon's case, the UPS shit) in addition to the basic capitalist principle of extracting surplus value
And thats coming from people like us who have our hands deep in shit ordinarily
No one becomes a billionaire without having their hands deep in the worst shit humanity has to offer
I dont think that billionaires are inherently evil tho. Not moreso than a normal person on the street
the second part is the most important part. everyone knows billionaires aren't our friends. the thing that makes the difference is knowing that they're explicitly our enemy
I wouldnt go so far as the second one, but i do aggree our system is super fucked and we need to revamp it
If Bezos was taxed like a normal person we wouldnt have many of the issues hes throwing nickels at to address basically. But as long as people sing his praises for making drop in the bank donations, public opinion is in his favor and he gets to keep his money
they're not our friend and it's safe to say that almost literally anything they do is not only self-interested, but also specifically against our interests and the interests of humanity as a whole
Quote from the video: Im not against billionaires giving to good causes, I want to ask why we even have billionaires, and why we have a system that relies on billionaires to fund those causes. Plus many of these billionaires have fought for public policies that caused our biggest social problems.
It's pessimistic as fuck but I guarantee that whatever Bezos donated to is absolutely mediocre at responding to climate change. It's always some kind of monkey's paw shit with oligarchs
I just think that with philanthropy in particular the reason is less important than the act
Nah i know it isnt selfless dont get me wrong
(good concise video on the not so selfless nature of billionaire philanthropy)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWNQuzkSqSM
Exactly. Its not the concept I have an issue with but the sheer amount
Theres a point where you dont need any more money, and bezo is i wanna say 120x beyond that
I can accept that
When the good tax planning hoards an amount of money that could literally solve homelessness in America I have no problem attacking it
Which is such a first world issue dont get me wrong
Thats facts, tho personally i feel lile then we are attacking people for good tax planning.
Bill Gates gets a ton of write offs because of the Gates Foundation and pays less than the average person in percentages
Also donations are often how billionaires get people off their back even though they serve as tax write offs and pay less with a massive donation than they would under a proper percentile tax with no write offs
So the facts that its nebulous and is not addressing root issues are the main issurs
It would be an unequivocally good thing if instead of a one time donation he supported regulation of pollution and actively created and sung the praises of solar/wind power
The Murder King fed all the homeless children today
Ok that makes sense. Cause ive seen a lot of people up in arms over it and it felt fine?
Its a good thing that doesnt address the root of the issue
Can someone explain to me why jeff bezos donating 10 bil to climate change isnt a great thing, beyond the fact that "donating to climate change" is super nebulous?
brawl legend whose tweets are now like 10% tournaments, 30% takes of varying heat and 60% being in japan
Is Mr R an Anti at this point
and the x-factor I think is that in some games you can straight up make music
and sometimes in games they have songs from previous games but with tiny diffferences
yeah I was thinking of undertale lol
The undertale Jazz album
you can have an entire soundtrack that is essentially variations of one melody
mostly that the effort floor is often lower
there are a lot of factors in its favor
the more I think about it the higher the vgm percentage could be
although there is also ambient nonvgm
it's also worth considering how much ambient vgm there is
or like nonvgm
because real music gets carried by ancient songs that are lost to history but those songs also have no remixes
I would say vgm gets remixed more because mostly modern stuff gets covered/remixed so traditional songs tank the average too much
yo this cover is so good
there aren't enough soundwaves in the universe for the sum of touhou remixes
does vgm or normal music get more covers/remixes per song on average
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic01Vhiyrb4
what about mario paint covers
it's almost never original music so no
should music game music count
Up and coming rock band or something
That was Rolling Stones rock band of 2018 or something
Wait they dont list soccer mommy
Trying to figure out what the minimum amount of obscurity is to get it to register
Im dead
Wait I typed in 4 songs into the database and they didnt have it
but I wanted to introduce it anyway
this could easily not count lol
https://rbdb.online/songs
Is 17 hours and its a list of songs that inspire the artist that made it

This playlist I have on my phone
Ok so smash ultimates soundtrack is 28 hours
Well I mean even then
Ohhh
Okay does Ult count as contributing like 1000 vgm songs
idk
I think the width is very big Id imagine
the width of the margin is the question
I feel like music would outweigh vgm music by a huge margin
Im not sure if I understand the question
but if not that it needs to be total seconds of music or something weird
I was thinking number of distinct specific songs/tracks which actually wouldn't cover a lot of nonVGM
well there are many ways by which to measure the amount of music
yeah but isn't most stuff that exists recent
it's gotta be freakishly small like below 1% cause vgm didn't exist until so recently
what percentage of music is vgm
Wait brawl also has sheik fox since that was like a 80:20 mu
smash 4 had a good amount of sheik vs fox
I imagine it must be a MU thats carried by Melee but the fox ditto also gets some representation from 64 smash 4 and ult
is the fox ditto the most played mu in competitive smash

Looool
and sometimes we would just hear the moon sound at opportune moments
I was playing smash 4 with Chris one time with an odyssey stream in the background
The space bar

Yooo let's gooo

What number would your moon counter be at this point

What does the victory jingle sound like

A victory jingle
Getting canceled
What are the top 5 indicators of success that you think of
https://twitter.com/ScienceNerd616/status/1228577764040593410?s=19
I'd say so
Midair
Are planets and stars floating
Is it staying in midair, going up, or in water
When you imagine something floating
Genuine question lol
why are there so many words
Andy Im begging you to tweet this
It's like the monty hall problem
What percentage of people who have demanded a best 3 out of 5 after they lost 2 do you think actually made the comeback
Its a soothing word to hear
Satchel Drakes (satchbags goods) says it at the end of every video

Im gonna say it
My mom says it a lot lmao
yea idk why tv bros say copacetic
It doesnt look like a bro word though
i've only heard this word in a bro/dude voice
Ive never seen this word before

Movies are just cutscenes
yo if there were only cutscenes there wouldn't be any at all
IT COMES FULL CIRCLE
@Michael Dellapi
And?
If you dont recruit marianne youte a fossil fuel exec
marianne 
It can go up or down and still represent a passage of time
Level of depression that is
Depression
Size
What's a greater indicator of time passing than hair length
A significant number of characters switched between having short or long hair
I take that every day
The make a hotness tier list without becoming paralyzed by guilt challenge

I got pretty close to S tier
I thought I was Sleep Boy
I cant allow this
Wait Linhardt in C pump the brakes
Your b tier makes me sad, mad, and every other negative emotion
LYSITHEA IN A   LYSITHEA IN A
oh no hilda marianne and dorothea in B
Eagles boys 

Idk if shes supposed to be but she is
Is Petra supposed to be hot
Wait is Petra Beyonc
Bowling and milkshakes 

edelgard looks so uwu in that pic like she's not gonna [redacted]
@Edward Cheung
He is
Ed is honestly so beautiful

In like any other pic hes fine
less competition for me, then
His hair just looks bad in the official art
Even pre timeskip Dimitri isnt bad
oh yea pre timeskip dimitri is horrible
I don't really fuck with the eyepatch
*understand
Timeskip Dimi I def underhand
in terms of only looks
unpopular opinion but i put him above petra and dorothea and hilda and everyone really
YES
When he broke scissors 

and it remains true
@Julian is Claude and weve been saying it forever
Idk why 3H is being discussed but dimitri is the hottest
FiRe eMbLeM???

dichael you're alois
You flatter me
Thats all i got
Nice hair
Hot an likable
In what way is Nairo Claude lol
TSM
Nah they have to be connected
Too likable
But they have to hate Tweek and no one hates tweek smh
Ye
Hot and wild
Blessssss
LEFF
Nairo is Claude
Whos the Edelgard of smash
Tweek def tweets like dimitri lmao
Thats perfect i have 4.7

Just gotta take his eye and make him kill leo
with a little work he can be our dmitri
he's cute
tweeks
Idk if i should slide into her or tweeks dms
All hell will break loose
Its me im god
I fear the potential day she breaks up with Tweek
seteth is like i notice yesterday you didn't go to class cause you hurt your toe. and the day before that you didn't go cause you were sick. god is watching you
@ghoulrunnings
I havent seen that one actually
But yeah Hilda is in that caliber of egirl thats like untouchable
underrated
hilda x seteth C
Im so glad theres a YouTube video Ive been digging for tweets
Hilder x Casper A support is soo good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-8o-t6oPew
HILDA HILDA
Hilda is in a tier all of her own
Some girls don't like performing it and you have to respect that
Its fact
If someone can perform Nosferatu they immediately become hotter
Which is kinda sacrilege
Oh, we've made it thisfar without mention of hilda
the true brain expansion
ok but real talk, we've achieved singularity by finally talking about fire emblem hoozos
Every argument people throw at me to make Tharja look bad just makes her better 
Tharja can fuck off Rhajat can fuck me
give her my number
she went to my hs
i hate tharja
yes exactly
Now youre speaking my language
Marianne isnt top 5 off of looks but purely story shes top 3
MAXIMUM CULTURE
after edelgard
Tharja
marianne is my fave
Im a sucker for dark mages
Purity is overrated I want power
Im also a sucker for mental health redemption
Don't make me prove you wrong myself
MARIANNE IS SOO PURE THO
Name one person that can pull this off
My doubles partner back home literally uses the Sponsorship RFA for rheas fat ass lol

annette
i can't believe no ones mentioned annette yet
who's third girl

this is what i meant to say
Understood
Timeskip lysithea is like in the same range as everyone else
Jesus freaks with all that junk can stay
Barry she just reads the bible in her spare time shes as human as you and me
jesus freaks are banned
i thought she was 5 though
RFA is my religion
wheres rhea...
Lysithea good tok tho
And we already know Counters are Bad

Marianne. Duh
I wont be taking questions
Something about counters
Lysithea
Third best girl? Excellent question
Barry WHAT DID I SAY
Justin youre saying some shit
and manuela
i haven't played but from watching sj's playthrough i like bernadetta a lot
Dorothea second best girl tho
Petra is the absolute best girl and no counter offers can be given
Ladiva
Time for Ladvia
Im going back to my roots and playing grapplers
This is perfect
i'm not lesbian enough to put dimitri below dorothea
Nah Im giving that shit up
Fuck you michael go back to labbing ferry oki
Justin right for the 87th time in a row
Youre all smoking nut
me and my wife on the way to oppressing human rights
crazy guys are so fucking hot i swear

Dont kill the messenger
Petra = Edelgard > Dmitri

that's even hotter
guess i'm black eagles again
EXCUSE ME WHAT
Barry hes psycho
he's the hottest char in the game
Wait I'm sorry Dmitri? excuse me??? dmitri? looking good?maybe blue lions???
oppress me, hot lesbians
But its more fun to call her hot fascist
i could debate for a long time that edelgard is a tankie and not a fascist
So i know all the routes
Its kinda amazing af tho
Same
ok but to be fair this concept isn't exclusive to fascism  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwKjGbz60k

Still havent played the game btw
Actual queen

Fascism route slays
I enjoy Edelgard she is a meanie but a lovable meanie
Im still upset I did church route
Thats correct
Hot facists, best girl, second best girl, and best story

Everyone should stan black eagles always
guess i stan black eagles now. sorry claude
Does that make Barry hubert in this scenario
Thaodelgard
ok u hold them down and i'll get the axe
or we could decapitate fossil fuel executives instead of trying to bio-hack our way out of utter environmental collapse... haha j/k... unless 
The ol fighting oil with spiders

MEAL
Expansion in motion
The progression of these examples

Oh wait is it just sis
Sush
Sesh
Whats the sis version of bruh
But I havent heard of him at a tourney for melee or ult
I still see him streaming ult
Whats going on with Plup
He took his 1-0 on Leo and dipped
Jesus fucking Christ

I wish Wizzy played ult more
Def agreed
SonicFox dominated a bunch of games but those games individually simply didnt have enough tournaments/competition
Injustice 2 was another big one but zero is more of a household name
NRS games in general were like SFs domain
Huh maybe Im mistaken I just remember that was seen as like <their game> but I also didnt follow the scene
Covering like 1 year
Idk if its just the nature of the wiki but the one I looked at only has 6 MKX results for SonicFox
Hair esam???
now i can't remember hair esam
i remember seeing bald esam and being like wtf bald esam
What is ESAMs legacy besides getting involved in a fiasco every 4 weeks
SonicFox won 13-0 in a first to 10
Also the Perfect Legend story is a classic
Pretty sure they were undefeated
Just seeing this now but MKX
Idk where to begin on this one


Like zenma
And like not even by red bull but like a smash sponsor that knows what they are doing
Who has ever got picked up for doing smash content
Alpharad is pretty high up there
Make him come to nyu
Idk how to feel about that
I thought about my most notable smash win and it was Dylan sprouse
I tried to think of who everyone knew
Because depending on whether you factor in popularity fow is like a top 25 smasher
Personally when I talk about legacy I mean mostly based off of career achievements and not now known they are
Does Japan know about Esam
Cause thats a huge portion of the market
i was also trynma think whod have japan
So like, i gave it to him
I def just like thought of him but he pulled up tonsome obscure  wiiu tourney and everyone inew who he was
Amsa?
Okay how is Amsa over Gimr
0. Sakurai 1. M2k 2. ZeRo 3. Mango 4. Nairo 5. Hbox 6. Armada 7. MkLeo 8. Amsa 9. Esam 10. Dabuz
Sakurai might be higher
Yeah thats crazy, Gimr has 98.8 K subscribers too
If anyone ever used Gimrs meta ruining tech this might be a different story
Yeah but Im saying if youre going off of that hes more known than gimr
Im pretty sure most smash players know who he is
Or adjacent to keitaro for that matter
Are you saying Sakurai isnt top 5 in smash legacy
First of all by what metric could sakurai be 5th in anything
This list looks like an ult tier list from twitter
Zero is mad impressive to be known in a game he doesnt even play competitively
My list 1: Alpharad 2: shofu 3: Gimr 4: D1 5: Sakurai 6: Keitaro 7: Zero 8: Nairo 9: Leffen 10: Dunkey
Its kind of a good way to add weight to the melee players lol
If it does that buffs the old guard a bit
Does PM confer points
Top 20 at least imo
Eh
Is Larry top 15
the last thing i heard about him is that he likes steven universe or something
Was the last thing anyone heard about SFAT when he moved to SoCal for his smash career
I cant believe hax has returned to relevance
However axe didnt drop a game to Owslas olimar
Esam was on miom
Its like more about relevant conistency in Smash as a whole and if you play mutiple game at the same time you get extra points
Theyve been eerily close in good wins/results over the years
Like axe vs Esam lol
Its hard to measure people who have been pretty good across multiple games with melee vets
it hurts me to understand this conversation
Is this what it feels like to talk about basketball
Damn
Depending on how long Leo stays at the top he could build a claim to #1
Roughly but leo has always been like at the top of the top
Leo is Mexican though
didnt he come up around the same time as leo though
Wifi :(
He reps the most important smash region
He hasn't been in the game long enough to have super fundies so hes pretty good all things considered
This is really what it boils down to
Feels 11 man
Hes like consistently the least noteworthy top player
Too young a career tho to be too high
Cosmos is doing about as well as he's always done toward late Smash 4
Whats up with cosmos
Also apparently kameme played brawl
Something around there
He was like top 40-30 I think on pgru1
I did not know he played Ult
Nakat became irrelevant close to a year after Smash 4's release
also so many of the known commentators have had long illustrious careers
He was never really high besides brawl but hes there
Wait nakat has played ult? Lol
My only memory is of him getting 0-deathd by Lima
gimrs smash adjacent career has been absurd
Like nakat was pgr in smash 4 and ult
v115
Not to hate but can we list what nakat has done besides get good in brawl after the game died
Naruto
top 10 names
Who
Glutonny is probably top 30 but his stock is rising in value which is more than can be said about most brawl players
Nakat lol
But about like
Yo wait
yea that's true he has a beard now
And by that I mean 15
Well he was 10 like 10 years ago
didn't he just dominate europe for a decade and he's like 10 yo
He travels now
In 4 he was really good but never won that huge major and often got cheesed in the worst ways
imagine if gluttonny traveled ever
Nothing happened but he just is getting bad results and also travel issues I think
He was one of the coolest brawl players
wait what's his story like he was good and now he's not, or did something happen
And his results are still solid esp in 4
Mr. R is a sad story but anyone who has a head on their shoulders respects him more than his results would indicate
But man yeah the more I think about Mr R the sadder I get
Izaw is my son but this isnt the list
Izaw is top 10 of something for sure
Wizzy is def up there too like no way outside of top 15
what about IzawSmash
What about falcomaster
Leffen is pure culture
But Wizzy doesnt bring the CULTURE
he has the leffobble
But wizzy basically has that, and 64
Which is good
Hes been top 5 in melee for a while and beat Tweek in ult
Like obv he doesnt have as many games
Idk
top 10
Leffen is def to
Leffen?
Probably
Probably?
Is ranai top 50


WHO?!
And one of them was ally
I only had 8 people in my top 10
you should keep track of a list like are there 15 ppl in your top 10 now

Apparently hes positive on Leo in ult
He beat zero and was the best in japan at least for a while
Kameme was really good though
Mvd is like probably top 20
Maybe even his entire life
Hes been mvd for so long
Yeah but I feel like to have a strong smash career starting with smash 4 it needs to be like REALLY strong in a short span of time
What about mvd
Lol
Not giving him gains
Or like
Ult is hurting Mr R a lot
Also I forgot kameme has been insanely good in smash 4 and ult
Hmmn true
But like if you ignore that hes the only pikachu how notable would he be
Hes been insanely consistent for a decade
Esam is in a weird spot I think
Like esam and larry
is tweek a super guy
Okay so like what about long timers but with not as high highs
Shuton is building up now
Or like amsa
Like their best legacy could be rain tbh
Japanese players dont have staying power
also rip 9b and stuff
thats like a perfect description tbh
idk who the top japanese players were in s4 but i guess japan was doing bad so there's no japanese super careers
LOL
Ned now? Lol
Like uhh
But not top
He was high level
no japanese players 
Dabuz is also top 15 if not 10
What was he doin in brawl
What about Dabuz
i wish borp and bizzarro could be on the list like they have insane careers but as memes
He went 0-3 in that round robin that ended him
like he's definitely below leffen
He beat Armada that time that was really hype
i have no idea at all
who even knows what pps career was
you've got HE WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED
Ill give him 15
He's at least top 15 if not like 10
Is pp top 10 though
Mkleo now
Im gonna say it
Nairo zero
Like you got the melee gods
15 is a safe bet probably
Top 20 in brawl with the only tournament win that anyone remembers now, high of rank 2 in smash 4, still solid in ult
I feel that but moreso like top 15
I also think Salem could have a top 10 smash career
He was
i wish m2k was the most known smasher
That's me singing btw
Mangoooo
Nairo is pretty known
the most known players
Pp hasnt done anything in like half a decade
You'll likely know of Zero
does that mean the top would be like isai or ken
But if you even know that Smash 4 existed
He could be relatively forgotten or never learned of by newcomers in lets say 2 years
Is that if Nairo retired and basically disappeared
The way I look at it now though
I still think Nairo will have the #1 legacy soon if not already though
Overall dominance is debatable like Sam said but when it comes to specifically 1 game I think zero is unparalleled
MKs just dont last long enough lol
i feel like sonicfox dominated mk9 upon his existence and then like the entirety of mk10 but i'm not sure

Let's play
My lifetime codenames win rate as codemaster has been shockingly high
Tbh
Owsla dominated harder
In a 2 stock game lol
On a regular basis
But zero consistently won super majors the entire time
A lot of fg players are dominant across time spans with maybe 2-3 majors
The thing about zero is like
Sonicfox dominated multiple games at the same time but not 1 game for as long
But yeah zero was so impressive he brought prominence
What game did SonicFox dominate more than zero
sonicfox
Lmao
You're one
And when i beat him he was like yooo you're better than zero
My coworker is a very casual smash player
But Nairo has been top 5 across 3 games for like 8-10 years
But from smasher perspective nairo might be better
Zero dominated a game harder than like any other fg player
Yeah zero is like a household name sometimes
Like Zero's story in Smash 4 is unforgettable
But if we're talking about like lasting impression I think its more about how high are the highs
Hmmmn so Nairo has been very popular for three games now
Smash legacy?
that title goes to Diamond_64
Does Nairo have the #1 smash legacy now
Well I chose the word intending or assuming it to have a specific meaning
but why meridian instead of orgasm 
i guess you can get asmr from non audio
and that the A doesnt at least stand for Audio
Is kinda fucked up that the term asmr was coined on a whim

~The Suicide squad
~maybe batman
~the Flash probably
"I know"
"But we're in space"
"cause the repelling force will send me farther north"
"why are you going so far magnetic north?"
the principle of slingshotting is cool
Because traveling magnetic north is like going to the earths magnetic south
Magnetic north is crazy, technically it should be called south
you're situation
Yeah grid north is situation
multi-axis grid north
electromagnetic north
True true north
outside of earth we need to give north more applicable meaning
https://setcompass.com/TypesofNorth.htm
but then grid north would differ depending on what map projection you're using
No magnetic north is crazy
There are 4 types
Since maps are grids
well theyre all more or less trying to refer to the same thing
Its the one used in maps
whats grid north
Grid north, true north, and magnetic north
There are three types of north
North South East West
Papal directions
universal directions?
we could create new cardinal directions based on relative position to the center of the universe
Because Polaris identity is derived from the North Pole
why not towards polaris
Would north just be going toward the North Pole of earth
forward back
up down left right
Or they came earlier rather
They probably predated the confusing terms
earlier and later exist solely for this
It would be addressed if you say move it 2 days closer but people just dont do that
put it in google maps
The main problem with the forward/back terminology is that you envision the event as either moving forward in time or further away from you and the reason that issue exists is because forward isnt the opposite of back lol
what would be your first instinct
if you were in a space ship and someone told you to go north
what about spherical or cylindrical 3d cardinal directions
we'll need it for three dimensional travel
lets work on that
do you think miyamoto is a lefty or a righty
Should there be 3D cardinal directions
#teamtelescope
Who is north forward to
is that forward or up to you
A cardinal direction is like moving it north
None of them do
move it up, down, forward, and back
do all 4 cardinal directions mean later
if you wanted to say monday, you'd say moved up
But it has less to do with English and more to do with meetings rarely happening earlier than anticipated
And people would understand it
Then it would correctly be Friday
time is 4d
I would still say Friday
Next wednesday's meeting has been moved back 2 days.  What day is it moved to?
You would be technically right but how much would that really be worth if everyone else thought it was friday
I think if it turned out the meeting was on Monday
next allen
Me
I see the issue but the unlikeliness of moving a meeting to be earlier discourages next
most people do
I wanna say Friday
fun question asked in class
Next wednesday's meeting has been moved forward 2 days.  What day is it moved to?
*Bob's best music video comes out. He is too irrelevant for it to matter*

I read that the food questions for different levels of wealth are was it enough, did it taste good, and was it interesting
Im hungry
Is answering these questions a first world problem
That happens to me probably too often for it to be second world
when you're wearing sneakers and step in a puddle
Basically I meant the question as like what problems are exactly whelming
And China is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the power of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells
When people say first world problem now they usually are just acknowledging that their problem is based in privilege/luxury
china is all the worlds at once
Yeah because China is basically a first world country now
You can easily have first world problems in China
That's a hellworld problem
is dying cause you have no health insurance a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd world problem
Did it? I think it still.has that classification intact
Yeah but first world problem as a phrase has left that classification far behind
But the origin of the term first world problems comes from the classification of first second and third world countries
Like the mid level of problem actuality
In the context of first world problems, not the actual second world countries
Because it is an actual term
What is your definition of second world
Wait
Or when your student amazon prime runs out
Nah my parents immigrated to New York p ez
What about when your immigration application takes like 20 years to go through
What are some second world problems

But its actually the general in generally which is weird
I might have said this before but until a few years ago I thought the attorney general was the general of the attorneys
Whereas if someone was considered a master of sarcasm you couldnt really challenge or defend that on any concrete grounds
Like in chess you need a specific Elo or whatever to be a master
Barring systems and organizations with official master ranks of course
Since in real life theres no real thresholds for mastery
Well its an entirely subjective concept
What classicies as mastery?
The mister effect

You need to have mastery of something lol
No
Do you neednto have had a student to be a master?
Maister the master
Like you would be a master of swordsmanship, not swordsmen
I feel like they own their proficiency though
Cause master implies ownership
^thats what i mean about the term master tho. Innthe context of a teacher it implies you ownnthe student
Thats why like if you own a slave youre the slaves master
If you own a house you are its master
First usage was 1926
Oh wait yeah
Is that the origin of it
Like the master of the house

Its the masters bedroom
The fact that its still called the master bedroom though is mind boggling
Its a pretty broad term
Like a dungeon master
You can also just be a master if youre in charge of something
If something is just better than you at something that has nothing to do with classism
No
Which, would, in theory, be classist would it not?
Thats what I mean
Other than like, in the apprenticeship dynamic
Ive never heard teachrrs called a masters outside of fiction i guess
Like Jedi masters
And masters of their fields
Theres like your teacher master
Not necessarily
I mean, in theory isnt the term master always inherently either racists or classist?

But what if it's this master
TIL even the title mister is semi racist 

The mister effect
Ok you stop that right now mister
Its so accepted that Mandelas name is Nelson

The only events that mattered are the ones that would be in the we didnt start the fire verse
Iron Man 1 was definitely in the 00s
I believe Avengers 1 was in 2009?
Yeah that's part of why I didn't know how to answer that question
Did any of those events happen in the 2010s
Or rather the primaries
A lot of things I'm not sure about I want the 2020 election to decide for me
maybe including 2020
Yep
wait this is 2010 to 2019 right
like it's more the general level of technology, the state of politics in general
unfortunately i haven't put that level of thought into it
the mcu started
iphones

what are the most significant historical events that occurred and what are their bullseye parallels
The transition from teendom to young adulthood
I mean a lot of things. I don't know how to put it into words

Or young adult
A kid
As a teenager?
whoa wait what's the feeling of living in the 2010s
Goddamn i'm gonna have to wait for my grandkids to bring home the manga to read it
the main goal of Bullseye is more to capture the feeling of living in the 2010s than to utterly break all the rules of battle manga
other abilities are more generic shounen stuff
It's not a magic system, it's a single power

But i want the overall feel to stay
I'm still working with all their designs
Dark entities that have ultimate agendas
Evil empires
Space pirates are big
More important enemies tend to also be after the titans
Enemies are after them for various reasons
The cosmic fish doesn't talk and acts like a regular fish but they all love it as a teammate regardless
In one episode they find a fish floating in space that is in a completely realistic manga art style
Transforming and manifesting in different ways
They travel in a starship that is reactive to each individual's mechon signature
His name is Gditu
He's pretty funny
The greatest detective in the universe is also a recurring character
Along the way he meets his team following various leads
fast and furious is just a cover
Han is on a quest to recover them, avenge his family, and uncover the secrets of the titans and the prophesized cataclysm
They took ancient texts and holoscrolls detailing important techniques
The temple was destroyed and all other monks killed
Han can tap into the cosmic energy that is their lifeblood and the energy of the universe at large
Being raised by a forgotten culture that worshipped these titans
But they are basically all giant mechs in some way or another
They come in many forms and are perceived differently
The guardian titans of space lay dormant in the cosmos they each made
In the world of pathfinder 5 or of mechs and magic

O queso

I only ever wanna talk extensively about my ocs
All cause you spent too much time in minecraft and thinking about how your parents will die

Could you make one have the exact same brain as the other one purely through science if it was sufficiently advanced enough
So if there were two people
Half of a pair of scissors yeah
Would you call half of scissors a scissor
#teamtelescope
Why is there two you said there was one
Im on the scissors
Im still on the rod
i wasn't in the chat from the beginning i believe
i thought we were just fucking around
We need chat descriptions
In order to understand reality we need to expand inward as well as outward
O sorry
Barry thats been the mission statement of this chat from the beginning
and i don't know if we can get to the bottom of it necessarily
like you're asking about the very nature of reality
I mean it is, but also not? it's a philosophical conundrum
Are the rods the halves of the scissors
Yes
Which rod is the button on
What happens when you push the button
I dont get it
One is mine
Inside you there are 2 rods
light year
That's ftl baybee
why is there a lightning year long rod in your brain
Yes
And you pushed the button
Specifically a light year long rod
Continue
And it's stored in different places yeah
Okay there is a big rod with a button on the end
Knowledge is in your brain yeah
Nah
so I assumed knowledge is like a configuration of whatever is going on in your brain
like that point of intersection isn't an "object" it's information
The rod is explaining lightning
information*
imforation
Yeah hard drives have a capacity for a reason
wait are the infinity scissors explaining lightning or knowledge
You can think of it like that
And you pushed the button
And a button on the end
A computer doesnt change mass when you change some of the 0s to 1s
A light year long rod
and closed it, the point of intersection between the two shears would move faster than the speed of light
if you had an impossibly large pair of scissors
but what is it
there was a good vsauce video about how
because information isn't necessarily like... matter
But not for the reasons you're sayin
Yeah so allen is right
So it is the transfer of mass
Lightning is a transfer of energy
big dick mass
And I think lightning has energy
Also anything that has energy has mass
oh wait it does in SoV
but dumbness also has weight
Knowledge does
like not that it should but how does knowing things work on a physical level
The entire internet weighs a strawberry
It does
Photons aren't confirmed to be particles ya doni
how come knowledge has no weight in your brain
Both light and lighting is just the movement of particles lol
The microscope perspective versus the telescope perspective versus the snakescribe directive
snakescribe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_pIPTih5iM
Debate it
Debatable
Much less weight or mass
Lightning has nothing to do with light
Literally the meaning of E = mc^2
Then both are wrong
light is lightning / ning
Both lol
Did chris mean light, lightning, or both 
thanks for leaking it @Andy Bow
E = mc^2
the new insane clown posse track kinda bumps
Allen lighting has weight
Phone in rice
Electrified fire
Burning ice
Melting wood
so it's like saying  5w + 7x =21y + 13z  how are you gonna explain how "big" that is?
i think that's a satisfactory answer cuz a reaction is usually explained as an equation, which is supposed to signify that it's like, a change in a system of multiple things of matter
anyway I feel like lightning must possibly have weight even if it would be impossible to measure
With energy release so hot it releases light
It's the converting of a solid into a gas
I was unsatisfied
and my teacher said it's a reaction
Actually I asked what state of matter fire is
I asked that in science class in like 8th grade
Lightning is an entity
Is fire plasma?
I thought lightning was plasma
can something like lightning have a weight?
"Lightning is a naturally occurring electrostatic discharge during which two electrically charged regions in the atmosphere or ground temporarily equalize themselves, causing the instantaneous release of as much as one gigajoule of energy."
That thing just appeared in a panel for a sec lmao
Lol i actually dont know
andy i need you to help me before i plunder the mha wiki for spoilers
Whats the weight of a bolt of lightning
it's not like, a freak accident that happens to just be somewhat feasible due to probability
but lightning does have an outright tendency to strike the same place within some minutes of another bolt
How big is lightning anyway
Localized what
I mean when you put it like that sure
Not only that but lightning happens in localized areas
And a comparatively infinite amount of lightning
I mean theres only so many places that lightning can strike
in nature
lightning often strikes the same place twice tho
That's just urban legend
That's not science
And they were like yeah lightning can strike twice
Wait wasnt there a part of the flash comics where the second flash got struck by lightning while working with chemicals just like the first one
also i still need an answer, are you fucking shitting my nuts rn
no there's definitely magic in the dc universe so batman has definitely gotten involved with wizard shit
The veneest
But everything batman does is science
Yeah but the flashs magic has a veneer of science
FUCKING SERIOUS
ARE YOU
That's the main villain of the current arc
Yeah lol
answer the question anduin
So it just becomes bullshit again
creepo
terrifying
is this a mha panel? holy shit this is fucky
They talk about the magic speed dimension
Cause after the atom vibrating thing
The flash doesn't invoke more laws than batman technically
So is every justice leaguer theoretically
Like I guess many comic book characters do this but he gets extra mileage out of invoking the scientific laws and properties that he wants to
The flash is pretty unfair lol
The word dumpling implies a larger, more mature dump
Specifically by vibrating
Remember when the flash could move his atoms through walls
My love
But the possibilities will still be less than the orders of a deck of cards
6 hours from now the arrangement of atoms will be all different
As an entity and not as a word
You define me
No
Words alone are what define anything
The words alone are too vague
Well even if youre outside youre inside something and vice versa

To another party that is outside or inside
Or does your position become relative
Is that the only state that is not outside or inside
What if you're in a doorway
Or a shed or garage
Cars are internal in scripts lol
What about a trailer
If you're in a car are you outside
What if you ate the chips though
The roll is made of the toilet paper
But if there were never chips in it it never became a bag of chips
Like, is a toilet paper roll by itself just a roll
And if you stand a broom up it'll stay up
My dad told me that he heard the moon was closest it can be to north america so it has a stronger pull
Even after the chips are exhausted, the bag doesnt lose its identity
But the whole point of the thing was to contain chips

This is different because to be a bag of chips it HAS to have chips while there is, technically, no requirement for dumplings.
But you dont know if its just a bag or a bag of chips until you check
Bag of chips has different requirements than dumpling
No its just a bag
Why wait for one day
I hope we're at the Oscars one day discussing this in our speeches
Is an empty bag of chips a bag of chips

This is a dumpling
Allow me to demonstrate

And if we're already conceding to one fallacy we might as well concede to another
You should encounter the filling in the 25-50% zone of the dumpling assuming the filling is centered
Theres an infinite amount of something that says otherwise
Nvm.let isaac do it
tf..
Oh i got you
@Isaac Nam
Wheres the racism
This really is allens twitch chat
If you get into the territory of one atom is enough filling you might as well accept the empty dumpling
Is a burrito with no filling a burrito
this is like if you had a dumpling but then deconstructed it so it wasn't a dumpling and you ate it, did you eat a dumpling
See thats my issue with it though
Then any amount of filling makes it a dumpling
And the filling is what changes that number
Why would you leave half an empty dumpling
So if the threshold of something being classified as a dumpling can be quantified
Yes
Because i think i would
Okay but would you finish the dumpling upon finding out it was empty
I still might tbh
3.000001, 3.9999998, and so on
I almost wrote a short story about this concept
There is a certain infinity of numbers
Between the numbers 3 and 4
Also. You'd never know if their was filling until you bit into it, backing up the idea of schrodinger's dumpling
Alright so
I feel like it creates too many questions
If a filling was requisite, how much filling would be enough
The quantum state of both being and not being
Schrodinger's dumpling
Would anyone care to weigh in


Pikmin
but if you're a subsistence farmer than kids probably eventually become negative cost and get you more money
if you live in nyc it probably scales badly
like the cost of making a sequel
But is it offset by the amount of reused assets at that point 
I suppose if another child forces you to get a bigger house/apartment that could play a role
Eh I guess the big difference is if you have two kids at once you spend way less on each one
At most 75%, most likely 50%, their sex is probably also a factor
But you could also have more money, idk if that should be factored in
Like yeah there are some costs you dont need to pay again and you might make more efficient purchases
Wait is the second kid necessarily 75%
Wait this is like a discount for purchasing additional children
I think it might just be a half life graph
I need a graph
there's definitely a point where the cost goes to 0 cause the kids raise that kid
What about the third
If the first one costs $250,000 to raise until age 18 I feel as though the second one must cost at most 75% of that
What is the proportional cost of raising two children vs raising one
Are these 2 pictures a comprehensive summary

Their culture is more African
Is this a comprehensive summary

Either they adapted to Australian wildlife or Australian wildlife adapted to them
Summarize what you know about aboriginals
Isnt their culture eastern
What about aboriginals though
Everything is western
So there's enough residual
Most of the world is western
/first western
Which is the main western
Culturally it's a spinoff of England
Geographically yes
Is Australia eastern
and are much more heavily associated with a school setting
I feel like recitals aren't meant to entertain
like what makes a music recital a recital and not a performance or something
i don't even understand what a recital is
you wouldn't recite a recital though, like not even because it's redundant but because recitals don't always involve recitation
I thought it was recite
I found an example that says put on
or give it
do you perform a recital or put one on
what's the verb for doing a recital
And if she's on her last stock the player gets fully healed by being free
Jiggs does heal to 0 after the other person respawns
Assuming it'd still put her to sleep
Jiggs being able to heal to 0 would be okay since she essentially dies at 60 anyway
Sakurai is a wildcard
would healing to 0% or being able to combo into a kill at 0% be more annoying
who thought rest should kill them and not heal you lmao
like what about the combination of Jigglypuff's biology and motion sets you on fire or puts a flower on your head
A night of cuddling with Paul ending in my death would probably be the best date of my life
I wonder how rest works in smash scientifically
I had the prima guide as a kid but i heard that had a lot of errors so ???
I believe that was the number in melee
imagine you're cuddling with a guy and he falls asleep and you just explode and die
you said 28 with such confidence
ok good
it does
but i don't know the %
wait i might have it wrong, that was a jigglypuff joke
imagine if hero snoozed you and then that killed him
that does 28% if you're touching the sleeper
what about falling asleep
:(
wait but then time is a perpetual dot on us all
since it's like an extended dot on your health
well that would make becoming out of shape damage, but is that untrue
while also kind of covering real life in a jank way
that potentially covers all smash damage
okay how about damage is something that would increase your likelihood of losing a fight if you got punched in the face after it happened to you
but real life is stamina mode
you can't die from a lot of smash moves that do damage
if so i think that's how i wanna go out
actually probably
can you die from a massage
and what kind of massage it is
depends on how many knots you have
is a massage damage
@paul
you can probably enjoy damage
i feel like it has to be unpleasant
since some things clearly don't do damage to you and your definition has to draw the line precisely
that's basically why it's hard to define damage
or washing your hands
does a shower deal damage
what about like water slowly eroding you
since if you're just getting fox lasered you're ostensibly taking damage but it's not directly reducing your health or even suffering any harm
possibly because damage in smash is pretty unique
that definition is super broad and it still doesn't hold up for smash
but like
What if the user has -999 strength
a quantity of harm that is at least significant enough that if it happened infinite times the recipient would be defeated
is it like
how do you define damage
Like when you say the United States
Which is why it should theoretically be the tristate even if you drop area
Well it is the tristate area
I think anyway
Yes
is tristate area the most correct or is that only phineas and ferb
Like Im from the Tristate
Is it technically more correct to say the tristate
This is so good

Do characters in smash blink randomly or is it a set pattern
It just isnt live lol
You can already do that
I'd use it to look at your abs whenever
I hope so
Do you think optics will get so advanced we can point our phone at space and see people getting changed on the international space station
Don't care, need that  cuddles
The amoeba may be more genetically compatible
Easiest question of my life
Meanwhile out there theres a space cutie trying to give me her number
A microscope at its best lets me see what, amoeba?
Which coincidentally is what microscopes do
It's not looking close

Wtf is this anti-microscope propaganda


This but with the pornhub logo at the end

Mooning
We were too focused on our microscopes to see the bigger picture
Who knew galactic porn was already this powerful

Porn stars
Wait

Ebony hole
So morale boosting it loops back to maximum efficiency

What a glorious experience
Viewing Big Bang porn through your telescope would be a good way to end no nut November
Holy shit the big bang of course
Sex moment
Actual fertilization
The Big Bang
Cells after work
coronavirus (literally) fucks someone
andromeda and milky way gone wild 3
Telescopic in this case
each allowing you to percieve the respective porn
microscopic or telescopic vision
what power would you rather have

If it goes bad though you could inundate your entire collection
imagine the glorious consequences to society with galactic porn tho
You can probably focus with one hand and be indoors
I think the microscopic porn is also more practical
if anything porn is kinda anti efficiency
is porn really about efficiency tho
It would be kind of efficient though to have your entire collection on a chip but like physically
black hole-chan
is cells at work or earth-chan better
We already had people lewding the black hole picture
Probably galactic
galactically thicc
Would galactic or microscopic porn be better
its so interesting that they look so similar
Nebulae probably
Would you rather see nebulae or the coronavirus
but you need so much setup for the microscope like getting the little plate and stuff
But I feel like seeing far-off stars and stuff could assuage my depression
would use the microscope for
I don't have an idea of what I
Fuck that's also probably a telescope
which one would you rather have a license to operate a high powered version of
Eh Ill do it tomorrow
But just imagine being able to stargaze every night
Uh probably a telescope, but I don't think i'd get much use of it in new york due to light pollution
which one would you rather own
and interdependant
so like the two could be connected
Well Justin the thing is, I don't know if the invention of microscopes was predicated on advancements we made making telescopes tho
see like microscopes can seem more intuitive right
Telescope is like "cool i can see far"
Microscope is a prerequisite for like, all science
To see
like what would you thematically spec into
Def microscope
Barrys trying time see eye to eye
its less of a competition more of a tech tree
we're both trying to see things
Microscope probably, but I don't think we need to compete against each other
are you team telescope or team microscope

let's go isaac newton sticking needles in his eye for fun
i still barely understand the concept of like focusing
i can't believe ppl understand optics
just by focusing lenses
cause isnt it crazy how they both zoom but in such different ways
also definitely a telescope because telescopes were invented first
Telescope since pirates used them
the app not the thing it's named after
Periscope
Horoscope
Actually fuck it
Telescope
A microscope or a telescope
What sounds more intuitive/ easier to create
subtle asian traits has more ppl than both north and south dakota combined
it's so real that fb pages have more population than like entire states

England has a bigger population than New England
If it was called New Wyoming it would have a bigger population
3/5 compromise where a human is 3/5 of an elk
Alaska has 1 person per mile
We should count elk more than humans
Why is Wyoming the least populous state lol
My friend told me her parents are gonna move to Wyoming and I'm thinking like they better rly RLY love each other or have elk friends
Might be peak society
This is fucked up

Rhode Island has more people than Alaska?
DC has a higher population than Vermont Wyoming and Guam
Wtf
Isnt Delaware important
Like, the importance of Iowa seems kind of forced, but I guess that doesnt make it less actually existent
That was why I thought about this initially
Iowa
DC doesnt count
Which state has the highest importance to population ratio
Lol they made a mega droid and programmed asthma
I would've preferred him just being a mega droid
Oh what. I thought he was just a mean ass robot
And for whatever reason he uses the coolest droids

The whole concept behind him being a rogue bounty hunter then getting mecha augmentation to have 4 arms like wtf thats so rad
He's my favorite designed character too

why general grievous the only character i care about in star war

That's such a quick way to make a collection sound so sinister lmao
I'm on shift right now and someone just said they were buying something for their personal collection
Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio with Titanic Leo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire in The Great Gatsby Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal in Brothers Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway in Love and Other Drugs Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada Meryl Streep and Benedict Cumberbatch in August Osage County Benedict Cumberbatch and Johnny Depp with Black Mass Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder with Edward Scissorhands

This might as well be my twitch chat
racism is an art
I had faith in pauls racism 
He mains lucario

He mained lucario
did
dis apologyman play lucario
Cancelled
Okay but if every person I could have confused him with actually plays lucario am I in the wrong or is he

Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Rahul Ramasubramani to Junebug.
@Rahul get the PR
He probably played lucario at least once
I vaguely remember him using Kirby in s4
He plays fox in 64 and marth in melee that much I remember off hand
That's a lot to ask
All
In which game
Tell me right now who smashgod mained
Wtf
Allen.......
Also if I did confuse him, which I didnt it would have been with apologyman
He comains lucario
You can't hide allen
Llod def plays peach in every game
Omg actual racism
Did you confuse him with junebug!!!!!??
His brother is Llod who mained Lucario in pm
Paul probably knows
If someone else knows why allen thought smashgod plays lucario they are also racist
He also played Luigi in PM and Luma and Rosalina in smash 4
You cant hide from the truth
He also played Lucina in smash 4 who also starts with luc
He mained Mewtwo in PM who is the closest character to lucario
Okay look
Its ok allen remember smashgod the lucario main
So is my chat apparently
Yeah especially since im racist
And it made me realize that some people have to deal with way worse prejudices even when there isnt a pandemic
And I felt mildly discouraged because what if I get quarantined or judged abroad
I was thinking about potential travel plans
I hope hes wrong
https://twitter.com/NYU_MeGa/status/1225184192557920256?s=20


That's a load of barnacles

As verbs the difference between destine and predestine is that destine is to preordain while predestine is to determine the future or the fate of something in advance; to preordain.
Was it ever high in the first place
I looked it up and my understanding decreased dramatically
'stined
destined
Or is destined just the abbreviation
The idea that everything is random feels more odd
Like if something was simply destined to happen thats not different from predestination right
The concepts of preordination and predestination are kind of odd
Exactly
The coin flip result was preordained
60% of the time, it works every time
Riiiight i thought that was hilarious

(i hope you're old enough to be familiar with the xzibit meme or this will seem completely out of left field)

Yo dawg i heard you like doodoo ass so i installed extra doodoo in your ass so you can poop your pants while you poop your pants
sorry i can't make it
the common cold, the flu, and coronavirus that is
I just saw 1917 today
like they're more or less 3 distinct profiles of symptoms
Well not every aspect of a flu is a symptom of coronavirus from what i hear
https://youtu.be/60reuuVTGao
the spongebob episode where the buses out of rock bottom antagonize him, but it's the D train and paul
There is a lot of stuff that gets done there but it's not thaaat unreasonable
I feel like the rep that the dmv gets is from the vocal minority
If I go to the DMV at 8:30 can I conceivably go to work at a reasonable time or should I just take the next 3 days off
has anyone gotten a real ID
Then it becomes highly likely
Until a certain point
I wonder if the more specific the activity, the less likely you are to shit your pants
Shitting my pants trying to do this

No one expects multitudes
Cant believe Im gonna poop my pants while pooping my pants
Damn
We're not gonna die just poop our pants while doing things that you're least likely to poop your pants while doing

You're all invited to your funeral
6 people were out at work today from being sick
Ah shit really
It's shitting and puking yourself plus the flu
I reached out to Carroll to go to the doctor but I didnt realize the severity
Oh shit
Wait are those the same symptoms
The same symptoms
Its gonna be an actual obituary
Message the housla event page
It'll use the same rules as the nnn chat
We need a flu chat
Wash your bed
In a congested box
We spent like 17 hours together
I actually dont know the symptoms outside of a flu
At least I tied Armada

Holy moly now I know
He recited it into speech to text
I watched him
im just gonna believe that you didnt copy paste this and typed it out by memory
and then there is the L, this L stands for the Lord and savior, the god, the religion of most if not all societies. having the lord in your life is a good thing, it gives you tips on how to become social, to become stable, to become a functioning member of society, the lord is what helps the society of staying stable and strong, making it long-lasting
but as you saw, there is another S in the mssl. this S stands for Society of self-control, of mindset, and of skill. this society became stable by the enderdragon, the lord that rules over us, the god that shaped us, the people behind this society believe in god, the lord, its like a religion. this society helps with the self control of the body, making everyone very healthy, this society will pull through as a good society for man kind.
however, the "s" in MSSL stands for Society of slavery, a society that has evolved into such big manners that slavery became unstoppable, to make this stable took a good amount of scientists to control the nether world which was called up by the spells. this society will go through, as a stable, hardworking society. which nothing can stop them
the "m" in MSSL stands for Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange, and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells
What does it stand for
After I pb by a frame
Allen you should record the entire mssl segment and send the video to armada

I think about how my name is Paul but I'm Jewish and how that plays against me which might influence that I keep some small things like a kosher diet
Jab jab jump nair jab jab up b is mash
I just remembered that Cassius' last name is Gurley which is basically Girly which might force him to take a more masculine foil to the name that he was given
A lot of ppl might form their personality with or against their name
Omg it was $12
And i feel like i'm gonna accidentally end up paying like $60
I'm about to get a haircut in flushing cause the local hair salon i went to closed down
They're trying to tell us something

That move is mash coupled with what twitter tells me is current spotdodge
just checked the books and it is chief
Oh yeah that move has pretty respectable mash potential
Idr but its definitely more laggy
Is zss uptilt still frame 3
The aggregate impact is potentially less than getting ganon jabbed once
Idk about you guys but its been 12 years and I dont know if Ive ever cared about getting hit by zss jab
Simply the reminder that zss has flip kick and a frame 1 move sends you to the 
A frame 1 jab that does 7% is just demoralizing
Her jab is mainly emotional pain now that I think of it
Frame 1 jab?
I dont know what I would envision if someone said zss mashed on them besides just up bing I guess
Wait zss might have no mash
chroms mash is above even roy
I hoped I would never have to say that but here we are

Its been a fact that Rob is a top masher
Expansion.
We've cracked the code
Holy shit
Wait like straight up are you just talking about rob
If you have an aerial that is safe enough to do a grounded option that is also safe on block you'd probably be up there
Since you could literally be dead and hed be throwing fruit
Its like a little unfair because he can mash on you up close but hes also mashing while too far away for most characters to mash on you lol
I thought about that and I concluded that 80% of his mash is using down b at every conceivable opportunity
pacman is somehow simultaneously a top 5 masher and a top 5 big brain char
Damn this wii fit mashed on me while she was recovering
How much should having literal mashing in your kit count for
Can Lucario mash

Like he has some of the highest mash energy but thinking about it he doesnt do it like that much lol
Yoshi might also be top 5
I just said zfgSip until I was done pooping
A lot of people say "imagine showing this sentence to someone 5 years ago" but shit imagine showing this to someone 1 month ago
I was watching a stream and took my iPad with me to the bathroom but didn't take my keyboard with me. I think bc they were still paired I was only able to type with the keyboard. So bc of that I could only communicate via emotes in the drop-down menu
Like not only does he mash, but his optimal playstyle is heavily evocative of mashing, and watching someone play roy is also a good mash diagnostic test
Are we in agreement that Roy is a top 5 masher
imagine getting mashed on by like samus
If you dont put your heart into it did you mash at all
I also meant the bury/grab mash consideration as a separate question though
Having anything remotely close to the dp sandwich chart increases your mash potential
Theoretically Roy should be one of the best mashers since he's designed from the ground up to get close and mash
You definitely get mashed on by ganon but idk if that says more about mashing or ganon
There's speed and reward
So I guess theres more to it than the speed of the mash
I think primarily of roy lol
When I think of getting mashed on
Recency bias i'm sure
I think Byleth might have the worst mash lol
Like the flow of gameplay is such a slow mash
Definitely
Its so slow lol
Can you get mashed on by puff
Just generally overall but like
Out of a bury or as an insult
Pummel speed
Whats the slowest rate of mashing that could still be considered a mash
but no, instead purely performative "ally-ship" that involves ruining a bunch of normies' commute
if she wanted to actually make a difference in the lives of these marginalized groups there are soup kitchens and other forms of praxis that actually make a material difference in their lives
so yeah opening a box of crickets on the subway is definitely something a mentally ill homeless person would do and it's fucking tragic and not something some smug princess should appropriate to "make a statement"
like their entire concept of reality must be so warped
like i remember getting mooned by a homeless guy at the bleecker street station?
I mean mental illness in homeless people is absolutely one of the most painful things to witness
Maybe it was meant to be a mentally ill way
that's such a weird way to portray mental illness
god it's so annoying how self-absorbed and burdensome people can be just to make some epik platitudinous statement about how we live in a society, that everyone more or less knows already
like i heard this story about some art student (maybe was tisch specifically??) who went on a subway and pretended to be a mentally ill homeless person and opened a box of crickets as a "performance art piece examining how people treat the mentally ill homeless"  apparently people were mostly super nice and empathetic
so transgressive, so deep
love """performance art""" that essentially amounts to being a fucking clout-chasing pest for normies just trying to go about their day
ugh i hate this shit

Same tbh
Her two moods

https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Demon_Form
I like to imagine all the times when something happens and byleth just stares at it with no reaction or emotion until the buildup of awkwardness forces someone to move the situation forward
demon alIen
Theyre like straight up a boomer demon alien
Omg byleth is so great
Maybe 4
At least 3
I wonder what level of math byleth can do
Idk if its in the original but I appreciate that 2+2 is just in there


Markdown is a markup language

Wait I just blew this operation wide open
Yo the sleeping kid could be Paul tbh
I was trying to picture the opposite of markdown
Ohh
When you edit a pic within Photos lol
What is iPhone markup
Its him fading away but as represented by iPhone markup
Are you trying to tell me he is coated in apple juice

What is that

They throw the grenades at you when they close the thread saying NEVERMIND I SOLVED IT with no actual solution provided
When you google people with your random computer problems they just take the grenades alongside you with no benefit to you
Shoutouts to the ppl asking what someone with my height and waist could wear those are the US army guy taking grenades and bullets for me
You can die to taking half a damage in runeterra
i'm pretty sure magic the gathering has done something like that in one of their meme-card packs
if a hs card had 1.38 atk 
I can't know whether to trust one Brand's inches over another
They all suck even for ancient yugioh times but they exist
Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Barry Tessler to Professor Barox.
Like what kind of system is at play here
I think it's funny when Amazon listings have their own price chart and then you still have to go into the reviews to confirm the accuracy of their uniform measurements
There's actually a small group of around <10 cards that have these bizarre numbers
Hey Thao, meet Barox  https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Barox
When an aoe does 2 damage its like yooo
Runeterra numbers are too reasonable
like your 2 drop has 3000 atk
it's like how every number in yugioh is x1000
Soooo much its insane
Sizing impacts marketing
And theres all the weird games that are played with hiding size names
Like if you only have one size but you say you only have small / medium / large it impacts people so much
Size nomenclature / marketing is so powerful lol

When king size isnt cutting it
They were NO USE



Arent like all condoms large
Setting the default at 50 allows for people to request more sugar without feeling degenerate about asking for 200% sugar but that doesnt improve the logical cohesion
And if you lead with my imagination tells me then it sounds kinda more legit even though its literally not at all
I will say like
yea i feel like it's something like that
wow I just realized you could make anything up
my imagination tells me the sugar level is really a function of the number of syrup pumps and the size of each pump
yeah
Not the most they could reasonably put
If you order 100% of a steak that should be like the regular amount of steak
Every shop rolls a d20 to decide the default sugar amount
i assume 100% is just the highest normal serving dose
Which is what Im saying
It makes little sense for the default to be 50
yea also sometimes normal serving dose for some drinks is 50% for some reason
Well the overall amount is different but like separately from that
Id imagine default should be 100
50% at yifang is way more than 50% at gong cha
Sometimes its 100 and sometimes its 50
Idk i dont drink lots of boba
Normal serving dose?
it's definitely different for different places
Like what is it 50% of
Whats the grand consensus on when the default sugar of a bubble tea place is 50%


Don't wish it into existence
I beg you
Allen no pls
Sexualize the salt girl next
Fuck BRANDS
God fucking damnit, BRANDS
Uh @Allen Wu I believe that literally happens in Adventure Time. The Lich, who's like an eternally undead guy from before life existed, gets splashed with something called Guardian Blood, which has such insane healing properties that he becomes revived/transformed into a baby named Sweet Pea. iirc Sweet Pea's character arc involves him overcoming the fact that The Lich is like, a latent personality inside him.
The sub(main?) plot of him eating her dead boyfriend's brain and gaining his memories tho
That was the question asked at the pitch meeting
If you could come back to life by falling in love were you ever a zombie at all or just thirsty and depressed
If anything it furthered the research
there will never be a better zombie movie
Like what
Warm bodies ignored like all scientific rules of zombies
Warm bodies
I guess its just that zombies arent alive lol
But actually yeah we might need to investigate the line between revival and becoming a zombie
Well if they buried mr peanut they essentially planted him
Its pretty nuts
but why did he come back as a baby
The average zombie is slower
g
in some zombie thins
He came back to life during the super bowl I think
i feel like they're faster and stronger
Yes
wait is mr peanut a baby now
But they also dont mentally degrade sometimes
I dont think zombies get buffer
like zombies are buffer sometimes
probably only mental state matters in terms of degradation
And ultimately
Zombie peanut
Wait arent we all originally comatose

Would you be like an inverse zombie, not a zombie or somewhere in between
And then got super revived to actual life
but what if your original state was comatose or something
But then what if you were always a zombie
Honestly, yeah, but i also would unironically call someone who was medically dead for 3 minutes a zombir
The Jesus Clause
Or else youre just like alive
The resurrected state also has to be somewhat worse than the original state
when you use a max revive
Well if you think about it

Or like your phone
And you fix it
What about when your car dies
I was thinking primarily human
Unless you need to have a significant percentage of human to be a cyborg
i feel like zombies can't be machines
But the robot, which is making decisions, wasnt abhuman
But that wouldnt be a zombie
I feel like zomnies are just anyone who used to be dead
If you just put a human hand on a robot thats a cyborg right
Idk its complicated
Yes
Are cyborgs zombies if they died first
Yo did you guys know the word jumbo comes from jumbo the elephant
how is this not illegal due to being dangerous af
wtf


Fuck

Oh I know this one.  Capitalism Liquor Uhall Loans Cuomo Subway  Cloud Limp Hamilton Delay

I'm not in it Paul
Theres a codenames chat?
Forward this
18 naked
Don't forward that to codenames chat
5 black
at which specific word
And I went to two of those schools
I said this in another chat but when you go to a school with no black people you know the punchline before the intro is done
https://twitter.com/RENNTACION/status/1224120497568350208?s=20
It took me a while to understand this
Wait a minute
Wait which one is Samuss disguise

"they'll be too happy that they have their daughter back to remember to cancel at the end of the month"
the future of kidnapping is having the ransom be a paid subscription instead of a lump sum



Does that count as intelligent design or evolution
Now Im grappling with the fact that regardless of what the inhabitants of all fictional settings believe the theory thats actually true is intelligent design
Maybe Mew was just fucking around and accidentally made all the other pokemon
This is funny out of context
I could have the strength of a gorilla rn but instead I get tired from walking upstairs
Evolution in general is pretty wack
We should legitimately consider the possibility that Pokmon came to be not through natural evolution, but rather through intelligent design
The more I think about it the weaker the entire theory of evolution sounds to me
Retroactive baby forms are also confusing because its like, then Chansey is the first evolution of Happiny but then why is it considered the base form besides the fact that it came first game-wise
The fourth evolution of Eevee?
What about espeon
Okay so venusaur is the second evolution of bulbasaur right
Exeggcute adds some credibility to this theory
Or do all pokemon evolve from eggs
1st stage evolution
Thats what it say on the Pokmon card
First
Is ivysaur the first or second evolution
Ohp


Ok
Someone help me get into this stall


Trust 1
mie
it was a codenames moment
And when he did the same I was so hype
then the next stock I squatted a lot then faired offstage and recovered
I turned around a lot and then did a suicide fair
The way we communicated yes and no initially was
*turning around
Then around rapidly was No
Like a subgame
crouching repeatedly was yes
Das beautiful
Through gameplay
And we came to a mutual agreement on the format somehow
It was incredible because we kept it up for so long
If I do then I get to take one roll towards him
Where he charges the bow and I have to counter it
I just spent two full minutes against a link online playing a mini game we discovered
off topic but it seems relevant:
Zero and post patch Diddy
The Eternal Samus himself
Glutonny has also pushed Wario for like 10 years but he didnt do much in s4 and Wario is good in ult anyway
Idk if anyone besides Esam Hbox and Axe are in contention
His contribution seems comparable to Hbox except it was across 3 games
Is ESAM the smasher who has carried a character the hardest
Agreed

I guess this goes beyond specialization since in general if associations grow strong enough they can just perpetuate themselves
Its an interesting concept because I feel there isnt much substantive basis to the appeal, but its become so distinctly sexualized that its sexual association drives itself in a way that a lot of other sexualized things and ideas do to some extent
Ive been thinking about bunny girls
"if it all goes wrong"
And then there is the L
This got real fast

The effect
Idk about OJ I think Allen and I synced brains tho
Peanut butter and pickles is real
Cause it's a trio not a duo then
Wait is this pickles peanut butter orange juice thing a meme


Johnny and Gyro 
But your super form changes you a lot
My design was minimally updated
I learned a good amount of haki
Were getting closer to the Sabaody reunion
It's a pretty historical thing to meet your end to
It isnt even necessary to finish tomorrow in U.S time
This disease is significant
If we survive tomorrow we will have lived through Brexit
Technically weve already lived through a reasonable amount of things
living through the aids epidemic 
or like they lived through all that stuff just to oppress ppl today lmao
If anything boomers became them
Well they were always boomers
only to become boomers
like american old ppl living through ww2 and the cold war and the civil rights movement and the red scare and stuff
imagine all the crazy stuff that old people in like every country lived through
But it just made the deaths feel more significant to me
I know its like that pretty often when older people die since there was so much turmoil in the last century and maybe just in history
But its kind of weighty that some of these people were alive for like the communist revolution, the great famine and the cultural revolution and in general all the crazy stuff that happened and this disease is what finally got them
It diminishes the fear and sadness to think that they were older and weaker anyway
This is pretty random but I was thinking about the older coronavirus victims
Batman and SARS
Batman and robin have no basis
Does basis in reality heighten or dampen iconic value
and this combo is fire
my friend is having literally these rn
AllenPog
The achievements of Yaseen the Writer

King Boo and Piranha Plant from double dash

Like peanut butter and pickles
Peanut butter and orange juice
The least iconic duo is def something niche and boring I'm afraid
But like even if Goku and Vegeta literally have fused together their team dynamic is more interesting since its more about not letting lack of teamwork ruin them, than having teamwork carry them
The greninja literally turned into ash from friendship or something idk I never watched the anime
Nah ash and his greninja had a better bond
So its easy to fall into a trap of having the characters losing the fight, but then they have teamwork? and win
But the issue is its just hard to consistently create situations in which teamwork reasonably overcomes the challenge at hand
I would say most of the success of Ash and Pikachu is supposed to come from their bond and teamwork as opposed to their individual abilities

So for example
Farfetched and fe
I think its more fun and also more believable when both people are strong but they have some compatibility issues that they need to resolve
What's an example of a duo like that that makes you say that
Marianne Hilda
From like a writing standpoint
I think its easily mishandled when theres a duo that gets most of their power from teamwork
Or care and tender love
Like death and taxes
What's a good conceptual duo
Def this
Or a duo that is required to work with each other to work at all
Or an extremely op duo that are mediocre individually
Would you prefer a duo of 2 op people who just happen to team up
So good so good ~
AWWWW
the most iconic duo is me and you
Is the iconism aggregate, average or derived solely from the relationship
Even if batman is on his own most of the time
Is the number 1 most iconic duo batman and robin
Do they still have to technically be a duo to qualify
Wait this is a fun question
Name a less iconic duo
Imagine tearing your hair out in anger and it never grows back
Its like youre balding from anger
is it supposed to be like balding???
The most serious of arguments
I think if I was in a serious argument and someone said I was malding I would snap
U mad also had this
But it also is inherently connected to fears of mortality and self image
It has the energy of a braum wave
It has all the energy of u mad
Malding?
Like
When you're so mad it's affecting you physically
Its so dumb and I feel like if you hear it its just so upsetting on a basic level
Haha
Is malding the most powerful accusation
!mssl1

Meanwhile brexit is finally happening and nobody is paying attention lol
Have you seen Chernobyl
And like you could choose to be near them or not
But arent some people with it currently just at home
i feel like they'd probably also just get quarantined or something
At what % do you leave lol
But isnt a part of this the low fatality rate
so might as well hold the L and just get it and take care of my SO
and that's not even unlikely
if i tried to avoid my SO and then got it anyways, it'd be so bad
yea i mean i feel like i'd just get it
It would also be impractical to get sick unnecessarily though
Like I think objectively you should dip but for a lot of people it would be impractical to just not be home for some vague span of time
I guess if youre living together you might as well stay and get it lol
No physical contact though
Id help them through it
Youre living together
Like
Fuck
14 months
Like how long have we been together
How significant is the SO
If your SO had coronavirus and you definitely didnt have it yet would you interact with them
*Trump voice* No one's dies better than I do, believe me
highest global smash power of all dead guys
Either that or they meant "First of the Dead" as "He's the Highest Ranked Dead Guy"
the first guy to ever die
he's so cool

it's already to the point where my name is anna on battle net, steam, every dating app, and every coffee shop when they ask you your name lmao
Oooh that's cool
yea i guess
Youd use anna as your avatar?
So if we were in vr world
annas awakening pic is literally my steam pic
fe anna
Who is anna again lol
i wish the switch had an anna avatar choice
anna
That doesn't resemble your self
What is your go to avatar

The fall of man
The invention of pemdas
Bommon bore burriculum

Its fucked up that you can type the same equation into 2 different calculators and they could give you different answers
You definitely did that subconsciously

WAIT THATS PEMDAS

Aunt *nombre de pila* I gotcha

It's iconic
I still have that screenshot
I want that little doll

i say aunt and then their sibling number cause that's how viet works lmao
Looking forward to when the quality starts increasing
It's crazy that we live in a world where taking a picture of a picture on another phone doesn't even decrease quality anymore
I usually say Aunt *first name*
do you not just call them aunt but in whatever language
What do you call your aunts
My aunt just sent this to our family chat lol

- Allen's soul
imagine if all humanity was forced to play animal crossing
If we all work together we can fix anything! Then have some cookies!
Hey our town has gotten a bit dirty since you were gone, but that's okay it happens
Getting attention and feeling responsibility and kindness while being forgiven by cute animal people
Imagine if inmates were forced to play animal crossing
You weren't upset until you were
Like where were you before you were born
Yeah right
yea i guess if life is limited in duration and afterlife isn't, life is just the tutorial for afterlife
Earlier today I was thinking what if there was no afterlife but only prelife
The g a m e
Or is it the pregame
The whole game is endgame
There's no endgame
Just paying off your debt?
Well what's to speedrun
Speedrunning animal crossing sounds like a sin tbh
Should I run new horizons any%
someone remake san junipero but with animal crossing
That's the child app we need
Helll yeah
AC Global Economy???
Pokemon Home? Nah
Ive seen Minecraft gameplay once
Server?
Ever done a minecraft
Our spirits will intertwine
I want to invest enough time in my AC town that my spirit can go there once it departs this realm
and is a dog
And is in rocks
Money grows on trees
"The AC Global Economy"
I want to live in a world where that is a crucial aspect
the ac global economy would be so bad
wild world
"You overshook the trees" "My son wont make it through the winter"
that would change the whole conceppt
imagine if there was a known limit in an animal crossing game
if we had that irl there would probably be less issues
its probably about infinite bountiful resources
Like maybe there's a villager who loves superheroes
I'm sure there's some kind of reference to superheroes tucked away in an animal game
there are like canon racist villagers
Suspension of Disbelief
Japanese game design
is it one in which super heroes could exist or even find themselves needed
Game Logic
what allows the ac world to be a utopia
the only source of political leadership comes from a trash bear
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3EHCTP3jic
imagine going to a villager and asking who their god is
No doubt
new world order
animal crossing new horizons is gonna be revolutionary

sorry first Metal Gear Solid*
imagine an iron gut like that
in the first game he literally hides cigarettes in his stomach
what about kirbys organs
Have you seen the cotton xandy raccon?
but yeah raccoons are mad cute
Snakes organs are probably scientifically interesting
The mere sight is getting bopped

o7
for science
my neighborhood used to have a raccoon problem so my mom would constantly catch them and take them to the aspca (unfortunately i'm pretty sure they were put down)
Socrates -> Plato -> Aristotle -> Owsla
i can never look at a nice clean white rat and not think of killing him and cutting him up and harvesting his organs cause i did that too much at an internship and now i'm traumatized
it's not a real xenomorph tho! it just looks like one
Speaking of mammals in my house, i want a pet racoon so bad

Nah, if youre in my house and you look like you want to lay eggs in my fucking gut you're getting Kimbo Sliced. Nervous dog can be there tho
what an ampitheater we've constructed here
thankfully it's never happened
we talking about the socratic method of thinking or whatever
insects sure
i feel like i can't kill a mammal if it enters my house
in this media,culture, communications class im sitting in right now this chat feels so relevant
Xenomorph nugget will get decked if he shows up in my house
I dont 100% know about ALL
sorry replying to this
I MEAN
And all are cute and deserving of love
We brought bats up because they carry more viruses than other animals
you turn into a vampire

Bat bites are like, super dangerous for that reason arent they?
/disinfecting
also they piss on themselves for cooling
bats are absolutely cute but they carry viruses so you need all kinds of vaccinations to handle them
there were a couple youtube channels i used to follow of these flying fox sanctuaries in australia
we'd be dead by now
imagine lab bats
But for real rodents are martyrs for science
Ah, I see my memoir is out
just make it red and put a hammer and sickle on it
the most barry post i will ever see

Rats are goals tbh


Mice are cute
are rats better than mice
i love... ratte
Barry?
cause batman is known for not trusting anybody
YEAR OF THE RAAAAT
I just didn't grow up with as much Spiderman stuff growing up but he's also cool bc he's very human and vulnerable
FUCK YEAH
AWWW YEAH
The article said rodents are 50%
why not spider-man then
and whatever fraction apes are
Yeah his faith in people and how it affects his actions
how cool he looks as a bat
Harnessing 1/4 of mammal kind
his idea of justice?
using fear, paranoia, and intellect?
Also his dynamic with the Joker is just really interesting
Not sure I just like him conceptually
or just the concept
which version
I think Batman might be my favorite super hero
adam west so much bloodlust
well only certain versions of batman are that brutal
Batman rules when he's written campy as fuck ala Brave and the Bold or the Adam West show
Batman is a funny guy
they're "anti heroes" i guess like the punisher
And ofc batman beating a petty criminal within an inch of his life and letting them get put into the prison-industrial complex is a fate arguably worse than death
Killing unnecessarily is like an entire subset of superheroes though
or measure it
Well, maybe, but how do you define "necessity"
Killing when unnecessary should disqualify one from being a superhero

Raiden's my favorite superhero
genji is my favorite superhero
Scarlet witch is a superhero and she ruined reality
Iron Man's a superhero and he was literally the owner of a weapons manufacturer
Deadpool kills people
she kills people
She looks like a superhero
What about tracer
kirby is pretty powerful
Yeah all the phantom thieves could count
falcon is based on sentai
joker is pretty superhero
to become a ninja vigilante
zelda being a weeb and superhero geek
yeah you convinced me
Sheik must count I think
Warioman
Samus
Sheik
i guess they need enough like 60s-era comic book superhero traits like viewtiful joe could be a superhero
The OC in X-men legends
Mega Man
Bomberman
Super Mario
i'm trying to think of any video game original superhero but idk
Superheroes dont have to be from comics
i feel like the main argument is a superhero is a comic book char originally
I think a big factor in superhero status is whether they save people who they have no reason to care about but the toads arguably count in this case
Killing the incorrect penguin baby has less consequence than taking a short cut in a race
Besides the fact that you can kill the penguin are there any other arguments against sm64 being a superhero game
He has a cape so thats a huge argument in favor
I was just thinking about Mario
Super Mario
Like is sly cooper a superhero
We may need a sandwich chart for superhero games
Can mvc be called the best anything in good conscience
ohhhh idk why i thought you meant only fgs

Twos Justice
Ones Justice 2 is coming out
Wtf
Ones justice
LEGO marvel avengers
Superman vs Hawkgirl top, Batman vs Aquaman jungle, Starfire vs Ivy mid, Green Arrow and Jinx vs Cyborg and Oracle bot
Injustice feels really weird
Actually the batman games too
Probably spider man
Dang what's the best video game based on super heroes/anime
He could just have Yis entire kit
LOOOL
Imagine getting backdoored by the flash
The dc moba lol
Thinking about that scenario is so funny
But if you got ganked by Batman what could you do
He wouldnt scale too well
Batman would be a sick jungler
Passive: virus tolerance  Q: Bite W: Some aerial maneuver  E: echolocation  R: Swarm
What's the minimum thing you'd sacrifice yourself for
Is that a passive or an ult
But this system is weaker in bats so viruses chill in them
It says flying animals have a system that detects when their cells break down and release dna randomly
The virus explanation in the article is pretty weird
but "It" could also mean them having so many viruses
"It" being the fact that 1/4 of mammal species are bats
I'm not a biologist, but maybe it has to do with the fact that bats are pollinators? I don't know why that would matter but I'm trying to think of  bat facts and use them to explain this
One quarter of mammal species are bats lol
Wtf

Which stop has a higher probability of getting a seat 
Thankyou!
Cause the transfer takes less time
Queensboro plaza
Times square is lower but i feel like it's a deception
Would you transfer at queensboro plaza or times square

The R train will always take an hour but if i put in two transfers i just increase and decrease the time by 20 min lol
The fastest path to my house sometimes takes an extra 20 min
Each transfer significantly raises the odds of getting MTAd

Absolutely
I dont like transferring
I decided that too
Why
Probably the bottom one
Which would you take
The first route is physically longer, but the bottom route makes more stops

Yeah it predates mankind
this is bigger than you???
Wait so you didn't come up with the pasta?

the "m" in MSSL stands for Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange, and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells
ok but what is the origin of mssl
and then there is the L, this L stands for the Lord and savior, the god, the religion of most if not all societies. having the lord in your life is a good thing, it gives you tips on how to become social, to become stable, to become a functioning member of society, the lord is what helps the society of staying stable and strong, making it long-lasting
but as you saw, there is another S in the mssl. this S stands for Society of self-control, of mindset, and of skill. this society became stable by the enderdragon, the lord that rules over us, the god that shaped us, the people behind this society believe in god, the lord, its like a religion. this society helps with the self control of the body, making everyone very healthy, this society will pull through as a good society for man kind.
i also need information on this
however, the "s" in MSSL stands for Society of slavery, a society that has evolved into such big manners that slavery became unstoppable, to make this stable took a good amount of scientists to control the nether world which was called up by the spells. this society will go through, as a stable, hardworking society. which nothing can stop them
??
the "m" in MSSL stands for Modern bourgeois society with its relations of production, of exchange, and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells

Christian joined the call.
Christian started a call.
Yeah sadly they were like people that I knew personally but my relationship with them had strained a bit. Oddly enough its the one year anniversary of my uncles passing today
Death sucks. Like, 3 people died in 2 weeks that i knew last semester and i was a wreck
M2k
i was actually really affected by the news that qinni the old deviantart artist has like a year left to live
Damn.. always mad hard. Im not ready for music artists from my childhood to start passing
it's hard for me to say who those ppl would be for me but i guess if it happened then i'd know lmao
But like its wild to draw a line from like, where every aspect of what theyve done impacted me
Agreed. Unfortunately I learned that the hard way last year because like 3 people that fall into that category passed for me
Humanitys chances against the robots would be devastated
Nah i feel that. Like there are certain people that are so integral to who we are that their passing would be brutal
Theres a picture of him in our gym
That man is literally my dads body building inspo
This is gonna sound odd but if Arnold Schwarzenegger dies I genuinely think my dad would be devastated
Like when the drummer from Rush died I could hear in my dads voice that that definitely had an effect on him even though he never met him or anything like that
Is that a challenge
Like everyone leaves an impact
Oh yeah totally
it's been crazy to me reading all these ppls posts about how they felt affected/inspired by kobe through some points of their life and i never knew ppl felt this way
My coworker and I were talking about how weird it feels when someone dies to some bizarre accident
Yeah
Isnt it interesting how the coronavirus deaths are perceived in comparison to Kobes
I mean I can imagine it but
Yeah I cant imagine a world where someone would turn that into a marketing deal
It should be called kobeef
no cause it's not related to kobe
But would it be offensive
Like it's insensitive but a japanese steak place could do it
idk if i've ever seen one in stores, only restaurants
i mean would we be more likely to buy a kobe beef product????
But is it immoral to advertise off it right now
You'd be way more likely to buy a kobe beef product right now right
Media haha

i love that nick cock
i love that nick is cock
pigs are actually apparently kind of hygenic and smart and sensitive
i love that nick is a cock
I'm a cock

No I'm year of the dogge
barry are u year of the rat
i haven't but again, let's go RATS
but I'm not sure how satisfactorily that explains the rest of the order
it's like all the animals raced and the rat is first because it was riding the ox
oh have you guys seen the story about the zodiac order
let's go RATS

Is that jersey slang
Something like that
That class was a blowup
Blow up my professor!
Just finished college! Fuck my professor!
Just finished college! Shout out to my professor!
Well you can say it with the same energy as shout out
Its slang but i call it a blowup usually
I think that's somewhat stronger than what the reverse of a shoutout would be but you could say darn to lower your severity as necessary

"Fuck _____"
I guess that works but you wouldn't say "call out to ___"
like the noun for when you put something out blast
A call out
what do you call the opposite of a shoutout

Actually idk  I guess twin just broadly refers to being in the womb with another person identical or not. And probably being born the sameish time.
But the dna that is expressed can differ due to environmental conditions
Twins have the same dna
I think so
But if you were cloned, could you consider your clone your twin
Biologically speaking twins (identical) are clones of the same fertilized egg iirc
Is your clone your twin, and if your triplet dies, do you yourself lose triplet status
.lowercase()
Or even just to group capitalize/lower case in general
It should be easier to capitalize or lower-case the first letter of all words in 2020
I guess it is

Fuck i don't know anything either i just like the move lol
I wear that shit loud and proud
You know tackle lol
I just imagine someone is just like youre a sternie  and you use court change and make them a sternie
i don't think i know enough about pokemon to know signature moves lmao
The move is magic coat btw
Got that soccer experience
Honestly Justin you are more of a court change
There is one I know deoxys speed runs it lol
Court change?
Idk if there is one
Whats the move that magic bounces
Wait no thats an ability
This is because of xatu dual screens isnt it
MY SIGNATURE MOVE IS MAGIC BOUNCE LOL
Justin Jones is def magic bounce
Thao what's yours
Psycho Cut every day
Andy whats your Pokemon move
My signature move is brave bird 
LMFAO
I love thao LOL
ok like i was thinking that cause you're mixed but i didn't want to say it and appear racist
To return to the question. Is normal dark acceptable?
Its more i dont hate it and i enjoy a stable job more than i enjoy marketing
i forgot only one person on earth enjoys accounting
ohhh wait accounting
are u actuarial
Im actually not finance but we take it
in that order
yea my pillars of justin jones identity are like finance, cloud, tall, and lylat
Im not entirely sure its a compliment but its gonna be one
Cloud up air is stern
Stern
I love that the first thing thao thinks of with me is money 
uhhh what type is money
Ima need to know me
sj is bug cause he's spiderman
yaseen has never started doing shirtless pushups at housla
Akuma is turtonator
Yaseen is too down too earth to not be ground type
ok maybe not horny but more aggressive yes
And Yaseen is resistant to electricity???
Wait Im horny and aggressive??
Dark: merkava  Poison: rat filth slime man
Bowser is Turtonator tho
Dark Poison
barrys gotta be dark something cause he mains bowser and merkava
Nah I just started working out very recently Im a ways away
like i actually have no idea how buff anyone in nyu smash is outside of yaseen, chris, and julian cause yaseen and chris were the arm wrestling champs and chris and julian started doing shirtless pushups at housla for some reason
maybe you are already and i just don't know
Thao my goal is to get buff enough for you to see me as rock type
yaseen is ground fighting cause he's also buff and can fight but he's different from chris cause he's less horny and aggressive like rock vs ground
I read this as Chris rock is fighting type and I just nodded my head
he could be psychic fairy
allen is psychic
I like it
and chris is rock fighting cause he's buff and could fight irl
Damn
you're normal fighting cause you're fighting in the context of fgs
fighting
What type I am I you think
"Joker trailer" in 2019
Or fighting normal
If I knew of a way to use my body in a way of attack or defense I would be fighting type lol
I'm physical
You aint special
I could beat up Chris too

I could beat up chris
chris is definitely fighting type
Rock guy
You're very sturdy tho
Im a normal type since Im a human
Long Nintendo, short the US market
We should all invest in Wii Us
That's what people said haha
what do u mean apparently
Grass steel apparently lol
andy what type are you

I wonder what thatch is up to
asian parents are fighting type

ikr so wild
And you get to share fun times with them
Imagine being that close with your parents cause they like what you're into
Sooo nice so fun
I love chris and his family
So it's my entertainment machine
can chris's mom make our next pr
I can't sell my wiiu yet cause they haven't put Netflix or crunchyroll on the switch
We have 1
Doesn't wreckonize have like 10
For what?
Buying wiius non-ironically btw
What if you like smash 4
you know the study is legit cause they spelled it oestrogen
Because its easier for you to get rid of excess heat in the body
If you let heat escape and have a warm outer body/ cold inner body than you are a fire type
Because you keep the body heat inside you instead of letting it escape, causing you to be cold on the outside
this is for a study that only concerns old ppl lmao
Chris be my ice pop
Temperature was measured orally with calibrated mercury-in-glass thermometers in 92 healthy community-dwelling volunteers aged 64 years and older. Environmental conditions were carefully controlled and patients with physical conditions or medication regimes known to alter body temperature were excluded.
If you are a warmer person than you are an ice top
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8130908/
And men have more external heat so they feel warmer
Cause they have more internal heat
So women just feel colder
Ohh interesting
idk but here's the article with the findings and reasoning but no link to the paper https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3630457/Why-women-naturally-colder-bodies-men.html
I'm open to believing it but it seems very arbitrary
Andy.of all the things to refuse to believe lmao
How did they research it thao?
Andy
Idt it's that specific
i just googled it and almost every result is like "why women's bodies are colder" lmfao
Youd need such a huge sample size with such specific conditions for each person
Like and there are ways to correct for all those factors I'm sure
How
I'm not a biologist
The data would be so skewed at any time
To prove if men or women are warmer
How would you run that experiment tho
There are so many ways to measure body temperature I imagine
Wait seriously????
If that data is based on resting heart rate maybe
I don't believe it
I can't think of any way to research that
Or at least that was a thing in a JoJo fight
Apparently women tend to have a lower body temperature than men
Or low rather
Usually high metabolism
For a number of factors
In room temperature
There are people who are more likely to be cold than hot
Right I'm just saying like as a principle
but no ones body just operates at a lower temperature cause we're warm blooded
And typing is more than just your body temperature tho
Yeah
If your body just keeps operating at a lower temperature you're ice
If it's because you produce more body heat then you're fire
Is why your body still works
who hasn't been licked before
But I think the Crux of the ice or fire type question
So it's late
Ok I have to retype this because my computer is fucked
my uncle tried to sleep in my grandmas bed after she died but her ghost pushed him off the bed

yea my family
Has anyone here ever taken ghost damage
You're replying unexpected but in the opposite direction
Allen are you okay
Normal
Yeah
i dont remember if that was a thing that happened
do we know what type everyone would be
I mean they are ice type

they make ice blocks and breathe ice
They climb ice
Well theyre not climbers who are ice
i guess it's unfair cause they're the ice climbers
Either way would they be fire
if you touch ics, would they be hot
but like if you touch fjorm she's cold
Okay if you think about the ice people in ice areas they presumably have more body heat or whatever
You're def fire thao
and by you i mean me cause i think this about myself lmfao
yea like you would be found in the ice area of the game but you literally produce more heat than other people
Producing heat means youre more of a fire elemental
Fire
Idk if it makes sense but like in a game you would be an ice person probably
Ice
if you like cold weather cause you produce a lot of body heat, does that make you an ice person or a fire person
Somehow
DBFZ died as a game people actually play to give us the hypest game to watch
dbfz :(
Idk what else he says
And mad characters just do the same thing as others but worse
Like the one time he said that character variety != game variety
Sometimes I pop in a leffen video and he spits truth though
Im indifferent towards him I never really watched him play
Or agree with him rather
Do you like leffen?
There is more but Im bored
And the top tiers are lame (gnw rob pacman)
If you have a good grab you are literally playing a different game then most of the cast
The most optimal combos are the easiest to execute unless you hard read the person
Aggressive play is buffed but reading your opponent is nerfed
Like defensive play is nerfed but camping is buffed??
@Andy Bow a bunch of little things
And every smash video is basically a video essay
Of any kind
Cuz I genuinely cant watch video essays
I was talking about that with my friend today
it's part of the reason why animators struggle to monetize youtube
Ad revenue
On the topic of padding videos: in general it's advantageous to stretch things out. Yugioh youtubers are notorious for making a 1-2 minute video into a 10-15 minute video

@Samuel Hill mashed jab out of my downtilt yesterday and i was so mad
I like ult but nothing makes me vomit more than when people get caught obliterating their A button when theyre getting hit
Mash game
Chris youre good at ultimate why do you hate it so much
I promise you half the player base has no idea that there are jump squat frames
They need to spend all that time explaining just so they can say dont waste your double jump at the end of the video
Bra so many players are dumb in ultimate
I respect the hustle
Rishi got them agency video titles ngl
Rishi coulda made that video a vine lol
No fluff they just open in training mode and give you inputs
Tbh the best smash videos are the guides that are 1 minute long
I've had frames explained to me likely 10 times in videos lol
On the subject of Smash Youtube I imagine it must be near impossible to make content to cater to everyones tastes
Plus poison mushroom Krool can stall with it 
The threat of dying to 90 in a juggle situation is worth the endlag
Even before the patch it was pretty good
I think ZSS could somehow make it happen
Krool up air is solid
I watched that video and I disagree with Krool up air but everything else was solid
Back slash is bad but if you love xenoblade youll use it anyways
https://youtu.be/3XOzwhQRuLs
Word it was actually a threat in 4
Shulk side b
Well my shield broke in smash 4 lol
Either on the ground or in the air, can't remember which, used to perform two hits on shield, now it only does 1
Fun fact they actually nerfed its ability to shield break from 4
Lol imagine if you gave a character all the worst moves in the game they somehow loop back to being good
Zelda side b is bad but its usable
Zelda side b
Ive been shield broken by kirby down b before
Kirby down b
Samus jab
Pacman grab
As opposed to your upwards gravity
Stonks
Also if you up b after a bomb recovery you go further, it may have to do with your downward gravity or some shit
I think it's based on fall speed bc if you use Link up b with the bunny hood you dont go as far?
o jk i was thinking about the old like high gravity smooth landing thing or something
I think Link up b also
isn't that like megaman up b
Sheik side b
Inkling neutral b
Like if you have a metal box you just die
I wish it was actually weight based
Pokemon trainer down b

Wait would characters lighter than Olimar go farther with his up b
Puff up b
Yoshi up b
Olimar up b would be better on any other character
Olimar side b
Wait im such an idiot guys
Duck hunt up b
I agree but the fact that Isabelle has both fair and bair diminishes their individual value to her
IMO**
This gameplan somehow works with Isabelle cause her CQC is deceptively good
You would force your opponent to fight the entirety of Isabelle until they get past bair range and then you have the rest of your character
Shield breaker is the same as warlock punch
I stand by it though
Yo remember when my ideal moveset had Isabelle bair
Suck
Rosas side b would sick then
Shoots a luma then it goes away
How does rosas neutral b work on kirby
Pit is bad for the most frustrating reasons
Or the voice clip at the very least
I think what he needs is brawl side b
I died to like dair fsmash wtf
I got cheesed by pit as smash con
Like his nair and dash attack could def be worse
Some of his moves are actually not horrible though it's just that together they dont work out
Pit is the bar
you could replace any pit move with almost anything else and it'd feel better
Other characters have no limit or go mode though
So we can assume other characters just get one for free
Kirby gets a mana bar when he copies Hero neutral B
Wait wouldnt all of heros specials be bad since they have no mana
Its pretty bad on bayo
Bayos up b would be pretty bad on other chars
little mac with Gun
Yeah
id take sopo side b
Would it just be a glorified in-place airdodge
Its an air dodge
Would pokemon trainers down b be good
Nah Ill take IC down b
ICs moveset
We gottem
Ladies and gentlemen
ics up b


Normals
Here are some more fall speeds from Ult btw
Is the cancelability coming from the special or the normals
Lucina would lose up tilt though
if other ppl had shoryuken, could they cancel into it
It seems mysterious that the prospect of giving yoshi any move sounds horrible despite the fact that he would then have one fewer yoshi move
I wanna say Sonic neutral b but I think Yoshi/Mario with that move would break Ult
Ganon utilt would be better on like Lucina
Ganon uptilt
Rob holds his side b back tbh
maybe pichu thunder
Gren with falco uptilt though
Wait I thought you said falcon utilt and I was confused
Imagine Pit landing falco uptilt and jumping 5 times
like it would just do literally nothing
Greninja counter
are we counting things like rosa side b
Because it works best with his jump height
Falco uptilt maybe
Sonic nair to bair
I was gonna say nair to rob side b but I think rob can just do that anyway
it'd be barely better and not enough to make up for the neutral
What if you got like nair uaired on a platform though
that'd just be falcon with falcon nair except falcon can pressure with nair way better
Like little Mac with nikita
What about zelda with falcon nair
But I'm def sure at least 5 characters could use power dunk better than Terry
This is hard because literally every good special is better than little macs
Power dunk maybe
falcon nair1
also maybe nikita cause other characters have actual alternatives to doing nikita
I cant tell which way sounds more literally toxic
What if the side b on was Yoshi
it'd be so much worse in neutral on plant tho
What if you got lick to poison clouded
yoshis super airspeed and aerials make neutral b so good and only yoshi could dair your egg for 40 damage
Dsmash to hope they spotdodge to fsmash
I dont want to imagine a world where ZSS has snake fsmash
yoshi neutral b
Holy shit
Like zss
Nah other chars could def snake fsmash better
Snake fsmash
Peach nair would be worse on anyone else I think
Like olimar down b would be worse on anyone else and idk if anyone besides Wario would use Wario nair better
Which moves are better on their own character than they would be on anyone else
I said Ive never bowled in the spire chat and everyone judged me
Is it that hard?

Lol its Alexa page is amazing
Wikipedia is only 19 years old wtf
Just saw the Wikipedia page on Wikipedia for the first time
:(
https://twitter.com/UniverCurious/status/1217068740459868162?s=19
When the only image you have of someone is their official website photo thats probably 10 years old its like when you see the light of stars that might already be dead
I think I said this already but Ill say it again
Ms. Pell
shoutout to misspell
How wack is that
This is more about pronunciation but through though and tough dont rhyme with any of the others
I feel like if you saw those words for the first time wouldn't pronounce them correctly
like there's unintuitive pronunciations but there's also words that defy regular rules/trends and words that force "one consonant or two" 50/50s usually cause difficulty like Mississippi
you can kinda categorize the things that makes words hard to spell
and intriguing but that might not be hard to spell lol
no like indigenous
Do words that are hard to spell always have unintuitive pronunciations
Oh we didn't talk about definitely but honestly I gave that word the respect it deserved once it gave me trouble
I think that's one of the darkest innocuous moments you can experience in regular life
I had a word recently that autocorrect couldn't save me from but I don't remember what it was
Were*
Society if silhouette was spelled siloette
Don't talk to me unless you've attempted siloette
the fourth
silouiette
Ticks all the boxes
Is it a French word
There's no way y'all just casually put the U and the E right there
Hou is in it
If I thought about it I would probably mess up silhouette
Meanwhile I under prepare for judgment
It's always a complete disaster for me I believe my autocorrect is incorrect at this point
I think I over prepare for silhouette
I read this in Arin Hanson's AVGN knockoff voice from the mickey mousecapade episode of game grumps
I always tense up for it but it goes surprisingly well
I was gonna bring up silhouette as like the opposite for me actually
Silhouette
Wheres your e dumbass
judgment is such a stupidly spelled word
Why 2 Ns? Why 1 L?
yeah it's a multi stage boss for sure
All I know is that nihil is in it but it doesn't help as much as it should
Depending on what the mistake is it might help to remember that nihil is in it
Annihilation can be rough
OOOOOOOO i remember now it's annihilation
Yeah usually when I spell something wrong I remember if it's one that always trips me up and I probably wouldn't remember intriguing off the top of my head
i can't spell indigenous
Definatley
There's one word that's super demonic for me that I always need autocorrect for but I can't remember it off the top of my head
some words are just your spelling demons
I get it wrong every time
Why is intriguing so hard to spell :(
That was only four words but Im sure theyve never been stated consecutively before
Believe it dear Watson
True
Ok fair enough but Naruto himself? No way
That's not in question
Kakashi was a spy as was Sasuke
Naruto's shinobi life 90% ninja battles
you can at least make the argument that detectivework involves intelligence gathering the same way a spy needs it
naruto has too many wizard powers and fights too many giant wizard battles to be anything like a spy
ehhhh
What do you think barry
andy?
wait sherlock holmes is definitely less of a spy than naruto though
Oh I guess this second average is from a range but it makes it sound like 14 year old girls and 19 year old girls have the same average height
The average 14-year-old girl was 63.7 inches or almost 5 feet 4 inches. Afterward, girls grew an average half inch during the next 5 years, mostly between the ages of 16 and 17 when they grew from 63.8 to 64.2 inches. The average 17-, 18- and 19-year-old girl was 64.2 inches, or just over 5 feet 4 inches.
I get so much mileage out of this in smash
the next bunny global event
Do it when Im back
we have enough ppl to do nyu smash improv

i hope that's how @Andy Bows dnd session opens
it was like a more cinematic variant of asking for someone's pronouns
and later the teacher was saying if you forgot feel free to ask someone for their name and pose
when I went to an improv class last month we did an introductory game where we had to give our name and a superhero pose
was thinking about the idea of everyone's preferred adjective and then I remembered
Thanosian
wow thinking about it, i just realized it's pretty easy to convert asian names to adjectives like maoist
he has spoken
I advocate for Julianic
when it's not necessarily similar to the person
I mean like when people say Darwinian for example
Julian-esque probably
Do you have to say Julianian or like Julianic
how do you make the adjective version of names like Ian and Julian

What do you think is in this book


I can make that happen for $6
I'd buy one just to look at
The highest praise
Holy shit that looks like fallout concept art

What's the quality of the card
But on the other hand what if subsequent cards have similar issues
Its complicated because if I accept that this card will eventually die, then I might as well spend the inevitable $5 the next time my balance is low
Keep in mind you're also paying for peace of mind
Can I get some economic analysis @Chris Colon @Chad Jones
So I feel I can put it off but its hard to assess the risk because it keeps fluctuating with the amount of money on my card which is between 0-$20
But a new card is $5 which would be entirely unnecessary as long as this card actually works
So I think about just buying a new one when my balance is low to avoid that happening
And I worry that itll working entirely which would make me lose the remaining value on the card
So the laundry card I have for my building might have a scratched chip or something and I usually get a few errors before it works

Its that much stupider that it didnt even result from a serious act of war but because Iran felt like it had to do something before deescalating with dignity which itself I guess is just the consequence of a long chain of fuckery
This is the type of moment when you can see that the present will be part of history that the future looks back on and judges
Its unfortunate that so many innocent people died presumably as an accidental consequence of the military posturing and actions
and now canada and the uk say it was definitely iran
whoa i didn't realize the evidence that iran accidentally shot it down is now like a lot and super real
Its bad enough when tragedies happen accidentally
This is horrible


This was sad
I feel like the theory of Iran accidentally shooting it down is too plausible to call a conspiracy theory and it seems like investigators are saying that might be what happened
What do you guys think about the plane crash
I didnt know Ukraines President was a comedian

It wont be long
ill just wait until youre 100 allen
this is more confusing with examples
So A. is if time stopped for a few days and you were wishing them happy birthday on the correct day but acknowledging that its happening somewhat later than it should have and B. is like if they turned 100 and you specifically want to celebrate that but their next birthday already passed
Wait let me provide examples
As in belated on an annual scale rather than one of days
Actually this reminds me, I was thinking if you wish someone happy birthday late you would say happy belated birthday but what if you wanted to express either that their birthday itself was late or to wish them well for a previous years birthday
New Years Eve is a candle in the wind
New year lasts the longest because youre still in the new year the whole time
You can say merry Christmas a little late but the 4th of July expires instantly lol
I feel like every holiday has a different shelf life
I think you can only give the benefit of rhe doubt if its shared culture. Like if someone who was jewish said happy new year to me in September it wouldnt make sense, same with the lunar  new year
Also would lunar new year have a shorter window than regular new year
Well if you can count that then theres like Jewish new year in September
like you give them the benefit of the doubt
if they're asian they get an additional 3 weeks cause they could mean lunar new year
This is of course assuming that you didnt already talk to that person this year
Jan 31?
Whats the last day you can reasonably say happy new year to someone
Like call it a barry or something
You can give it a pass because its otherwise awkward to refer to the distance light travels in a year but in this situation dont scientists usually just make up a word
it's probably there because it's useful to physicists but when we're not thinking in those terms it's like "Oh right i have to do math to use this"
It's weird because the term expects you to like, do the algebra of "OK, light's speed which is distance/time times time the time cancels out so it's a measure of distance"
I am the clown
LOL
See thats exactly what Im saying lol
Im dumb
It measures distance right...
But idk if theres anything else as blatantly misleading in the world of measurements
Like, its acceptable to clown on people for thinking a light year measures time
I mean, prob nomenclature. But its used so much its acceptable at this point
Is light-year acceptable or just bad nomenclature
1. Then rounding moves it up

I haven't read a single Harry Potter book and only saw the first movie
Children born after the dark lords defeat have reached adolescence

Perhaps
But like is perceiving beauty ultimately just an eye test
Sometimes its so hard to tell and I fear Im jeopardizing my results
I get so stressed out during eye tests when I have to say which version is clearer
Omg this reminds me actually
Like if you messed with the features of the two clones one would always simply be more attractive to you as long as there was perceivable difference
Maybe there are only comparisons
In either case everything probably gets weird if you think about it too much
I think when it comes to evaluating potential partners theres like merit/demerit approaches? And probably something more composite
And then you have a copy of them but with some flaw, is there some amount of positive features you could add to them to make them the same attractiveness to you as the original
Like if you had an average person
I wonder how we perceive and compare attractiveness
Last years top strains were H1N1 and shulk

But now Im reading about how every year they guess what the top strains are for determine what to vaccinate against and its pretty interesting
Im trying to google whether you can get the flu even if you got a flu shot but I accidentally worded it like an anti vaxxer
is pueblo plural

what about
So i think megamans up tilt falls under shoryuken but not dp
so luigi cyclone
It also should be a special move
I guess bonus points if its both
I read up on this chat and as someone whos played a bunch of fighting games, a DP is a move that has invincibility and can be used as a reversal OR it is a move that moves the character up into the air with a hitbox
https://clips.twitch.tv/CoyFilthyAlbatrossPupper
It will
My video will never have enough clips at this rate
I got back to ny today
I couldve come over after lmbm yesterday
Luigi is the ultimate shoto
Come over
When are you doing that for my combo'd video
https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/bkx6mp/yo_he_hit_him_with_the_rob_side_b_credit_itsepic/?ref=share&ref_source=link

Dancing blade is a tatsu
is her pole dancing taunt a tatsu
You could also argue palu has all 3
Luigi could probably fill the diagonal of the 3x3 with his moves alone
I got doc fireball to dp on chris
i think mario and luigi were legitimately supposed to be shotos at first
The ultimate fg character
If Luigi counts for that too he has a fireball tatsu and like 3 dps
kirby nair
Rob side b
actually yea i guess normal sbk is like ken tatsu
https://twitter.com/crudbone/status/1212554808818712577?s=20
sbk is like flash kick
I dont play SF like that but i thought it did the same thing more or less
Oh it's not?
like chun li spinning bird kick is already not tatsu
Spinning bird kick is a tatsu
A tatsu is a tatsu
is anything tatsu besides tatsu
Is it a spinning kick
Whats a tatsu
A fastball is a fireball
And cant be interacyable
It has to occupy a linear direction
If either person can interact with it too much it isnt a fireball anymore
pit arrow
Ino Im guilty gear has a controllable fireball
Oh wait theres hothead
But I think all smash fireballs are fireballs so its fine
Nah I was thinking about that
Samus's side-b is a fireball to me though
None of us even considered that it has to be a fireball
You should have like no control over it lol
and in that case it's specifically because it takes time to charge up

but also like samus's charge shot doesn't feel like a fireball
Yeah Id agree
yeah that too
Isnt that more the end lag
because you can't easily throw it out and start doing something else casually
Like I don't think Falco's pistol in the recent smash games is a fireball
I feel like it's important for there to not be a lot of start-up for it to specifically be a fireball
Idk I feel like weve gone too far if Luigi cycloning an ice shot is dping a fireball
Without a doubt
But Charge Shot 2?
Charge Shot 1 hell no
is charge shot a fireball
Chemical warfare with no known cure is a DP
Excellent
Yes
Im there
Ice climbers neutral b is a fireballl
I think its like a basic horizontalish projectile
That would explain my tendency to buy tickets on ceremonial occasions
Is that any projectile that causes someone to jump
What's a fireball
Belay
Is winning the lottery a DP
I feel like someone breaking up with you while wearing a suit of armor is a DP
Luigi down b is an air DP for sure
I wish I didnt have to say this but Luigi down b has invincibility
Ill say yes
Like it has to have the potential to hurt me
Wait legitimately what about pkt2 if you go up
Im feeling damage has to be a factor
THAO
you're invincible and rise up on a platform
Like you take the damage
What if you do megaman utilt with a super star
wait what about dying
You can eat through focus attack
Its also not an invul reversal its one hit of armor
Nah thats a focus attack
D - race P - car
Dragoon
ken focus attack jumps a little
I cant accept blue falcon as a dp
What about what Ill do after if you keep talking about olimar whistling
is focus attack a dp
Also it's actually super armor so fuck what I said
But what about what he does after
No
Its invincible but it doesnt reverse anything cuz it cant hurt you
is almost every final smash a dp
I think invincibility is definitely one of the axes
https://ultimateframedata.com/hitboxes/Olimar/OlimarPikminOrder.gif
This is one persons answer
It's an "invincible reversal," and basically any invincible reversal can be called a DP, especially if it uses that stick motion. If it's a charge down>up move, it's usually called a Flash Kick instead, after Guile's move.
Now Im lost
If you need copious endlag shoryu isnt a dp
I think one of the SF games lets you anyway
But some games you can act out of a DP
Like being able to act after it
Can the other axis be if you mash it to kill
Thats the other thing
Copious amounts of endlag
We didn't even consider another aspect
I was gonna say Mario up b is more of a DP than megaman utilt but my heart cant accept that
Now Im lost
Or maybe it doesnt
I feel like it has to be a reversal
Like Mario utilt is visually similar but pretty dubious
Actually no I should dial back
Is it a rising attack
Hm
Because theres degrees of closeness to that
Is it a rising uppercut
Thats why I was thinking the question could be like
Esp since people could realistically refer to megaman utilt as a DP
I think punch/attack/etc should be one set of categories
Punch/No invincibility
Its based on Ryu shoryu I believe
Can we safely call megaman utilt a dp

Okay at the very least ryu and ken have dps right
Barry no
HOW MANY TIMES I BEEN SAY THIS
Youre right
Anything that is called a reversal option instead of a DP is probably on the later columns/rows of the chart
Gotcha
No
Or no
Right
Bowser UpB is a DP
True
I think the motion can safely not be a qualifier in smash at least
If I walk forward, crouch, walk forward and punch
Should I be considering the motion before the property

Oh wait what

I dont think that affects anything
At like frames 5-9 for some reason
It has intangability after the hitbox comes out
Nah its just fast I think
Is g&w up b invincible
Im still not sold on the punch
Since we are talking about an Invincible Punch
So like rising in a forklift
Yeah actually invincibility and punch might be the factors
Like anything that raises me vertically and is invincible
I feel like invincibility is an important factor
snake up b has heavy armor
Oh it does
If it has super armor Id say yes
It technically has super armor
up b
is charizard up a dp
I think we have to look at what the sloppiest thing you could call a DP is and work our way between that and a SF2 Dragon Punch
Uh both I feel
well is that your alignment stance or like your meta stance
Or like swords
I feel like DPs phased out of being punches quick but it could be considered
You can have dps that are rising kicks
I say no
or like an uppercut specifically
should whether or not it's a punch be a factor
Standing up is a DP
Invincible Air invincible No invincibility   and  Anti air attack  Attack Not an attack   ?
do you have to be invincible
Dp*
Do you have to leave the ground
There should be a do alignment chart


Being in flight mode used to be an act of adrenaline but now its the most sedentary state
I suppose its because a significant component of the perceived tragedy of a death is the extent to which it damages a family structure and people are often the least involved with families in their 20s
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club
27 club 
Its also probably more tragic to die in your 30s than in your 20s which is weird
I guess its like if someone dies of natural causes you dont feel they were robbed but then you have the sadness of things and people being impermanent even without anything happening
But I think if youre measuring sadness (as awkward as that inherently is) missing out on the sensation of unfairness makes a big difference
And an inevitable and reasonable death stings in its own weird way
I see what you mean because that type of person generates a lot of sadness in a different way
because he built up goodwill from other people
even if "his time came" so to speak
like it's super sad when an old person who was known for being super kind and nice
and not "tragic" necessarily
I think it would be a more contentious if the question was how sad it was not just for the sake of the person dying
Because tbh when youre in in like 7th grade your childlike appeal is fading but you arent respectable yet
Okay it might peak at just before youre a young adult and just before youre a teen
But theres also the young child factor
preteens have dreams and stuff but the sadness builds up for a few more years
like the age when people have dreams and goals and defined personalities so you have some idea of what the world missed out on
It might peak at like 16
imo it's 15-20
Or what is the graph of tragedy vs age
Whats the most tragic age to die at
Maybe cause if a car crashes they have to too you from flying forward while a planes seatbelts primary job is to hold you down during turbulence?
axises?
axes?
Like planes move in three axis right?
I guess because of how planes and cars do different kinds movement? I don't know if that's the actual reason but that's my guess
Why do cars and planes have different seatbelts

For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. Hebrews 4:12
Yeah its kind of hard to discuss potential harm without at least the faint veneer of chuniism
"Definition of double-edged sword. : something that has or can have both favorable and unfavorable consequences This much freedom of expression and opinion can be a double-edged sword."
Damn thats such an uncool phrase it might not be chuni

Ah this is something of a thing that can benefit but also hurt you

Yeah like the immense amount of force I want to concentrate around you in a hugging motion
The crazy process of putting immense force on concentrated space particles together
I know it's cheesy but there's truth to the whole "we're descended from the stars" thing
Like you pick up a random rock and think how the hell did it get here

Yo whoever invented the term jetpack was a genius
This was the peak midpoint of brain expansion and the Chad chat
What if you had a jet pack

Also a regular pull up doesn't ascend/descend in a fixed plane so its harder based on the stability needed to control the motion
The vest could theoretically mess up leverages too
Theoretically it should be the same but it'd depend on how accurate each 20 pound measurement is
Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Justin Jones to Chad Jones.
I too am chad
Ayyye whaddup guys
This is the Chad chat
Also add me to chad chat i go to the gym 3 times a week AND counted calories all last summer
No, cause the assist is pushing against you with 20 pounds of force while the vest is pulling down and given equal weight pushing something is easier than pulling somethk.v
I wanna say it wouldnt be the same because if you changed the numbers to like 1000 clearly it wouldnt be the same
This is for the chad chat
If you use a 20 pound assist for a pull-up while wearing a 20 pound weighted vest would it be the difficulty of a regular pull-up

Is this your emoji essentiality tier list
How come nobody ever sees each other on this side
I started thinking about this because I thought wechat didnt have a basic sleeping emoji but I realize now that I just missed it
:)   
Its complicated because at some point the nonface ones start beating out the less essential faces
Fair enough

As boring as :) might be I feel like it would just be weird if we only had one and it was anything else
But I would probably get the most use out of it
I wouldnt want it as my one
But if you could only keep one emoji would it really be that one
Top tier cancelling plans emoji
I think  might be above it
I think an exclamation point often conveys the same emotion as a smiley face
Maybe happy -> sad -> angry -> surprised -> sick
The priority is being able to convey basic/common emotions factoring in considerations like how often theyre needed and whether you can express them with existing emotes
And I guess after that you should have a sad face and then an angry face?
I think if you could only have 1 it should probably just be the happy one
What is the order of emoji essentiality

The more I think about it the more valid notification could be as a word but it still seems unnecessarily long and awkward because its referring to the act of the notifying itself rather than the content
Apparently the founder of Planned Parenthood was against abortion but I guess thats not surprising when you go back in history
although you could argue that's parenthood related actually
planned parenthood does so much not parenthood stuff now anyways i guess like trans healthcare
The end result of the experience is leading you to want to plan your life
Planned parenthood sounds more hopeful
And notifications on phones are primarily notifications
Well theyre like planning to not enter parenthood though right
Did you get the message, did you get the memo, etc
Well whenever you use the term notification there could usually be some other word more in context to replace it
Planned parenthood is for birth control/abortions for people who got pregnant accidentally and want to plan their parenthood instead right?
I guess because you note the object but you notify the person
But if someone notes you instead of notifying you it doesnt sound right
You can get a note or a notification
Eh its not the same thing
the verb of note could also be note instead of notify
I guess just note is vague
But then whats stopping there from being notificationifying
Well its notification right
Wait isn't it though?
Wouldnt it be way simpler if the noun of notify was note
And I still dont know but I suppose I gained ancillary knowledge
I was reading about Planned Parenthood because I never understood why its called that
Anti-abortion violence is such an egregious instance of hypocrisy

110% = 80% 200%= 97% 1 million%= 54%
Why
200%
Who do you think worked the hardest
If 3 people told you they gave 110%, 200%, and a million percent respectively

I mean if someone commits murder than society needs to respond somehow but there is essentially no action that would be good and thats because the bad thing happened before this stage in the process
Crime itself does not fit into an ideal society so mechanisms of justice are necessarily ugly and imperfect
Its kind of a shame
The entire concept of pleas makes sense from a practical concept but is also not even that connected to right and wrong
Like, to what extent should how bad someone feels about their crime really influence their punishment
Laws are clearly tied to morals and it makes sense but you could conceive of a system that is less connected
Morality is based on culture and upbringing to an insane degree
Arent there common moral elements that we kind of based it off of
They seem, and I suppose mostly are logical constructions but the human element is actually so pervasive
Its interesting how large of an effect feelings have on justice systems

The degradation of DNA

Is there any fundamental barrier to science eventually making people immortal
Like it would be an anomaly if the very likely thing didnt occur
Very likely means its almost guaranteed to happen
Very likely
I meant might more than probably but it still applies either way
Like you never say Ill probably do my work early
While sometimes when you say definitely you arent sure but are trying to convince yourself
But a lot of the time when you say youll probably do something you already mentally committed and are trying to sound low key about it
I never thought about this before

That's my mental schema and it makes very little sense but it's how i think of the two terms
When people say "most likely" I tend to imagine a tub of scenarios, where saying "most likely" means that it is the event that will occur with the highest likelihood out of all the other scenarios.  Where as "likely" removes this idea of other scenarios occuring
So I changed to that but then felt confused
I wrote most likely in an email but just likely felt more confident to me
I feel as though likely is the most convincing
I glitched ignore that
Actually no
Most > likely > more
Likely or most likely
Which sounds more convincing
    
The Andy Bow Effect set the emoji to .


Wait a minute
You could make the argument that all narratives are untrustworthy or unreliable but it doesnt sound right to argue that theyre all inconsistent
Variability
To put it another way
Apparently mercurialness is a word
Based on certain perspectives you believe different things to have happened
Aren't they tho
Like in some situations while your perception will change dramatically depending on whose perspective youre getting, the facts of what happened arent in question
Trustworthy
Can they be reliable
The thing with inconsistent is that narratives can be consistent I think
The shenanicans and shenanicants
Instability always has a negative connotation
Impermanence is what I'd wanna use but it has the implication that it's the narrative itself that won't last and not necessarily the message
The tomfoolery
The murkdungle of narratives
I.e. it ought to be consistent
I think he means inconsistent implies it's unstable in a negative way
Flip-flopability
Same that's why I said the word itself without trying to make it work lol
Add up?
I considered mercurial but I gave up because I couldnt think of a good noun form lol
Inconsistency is like something doesnt add up
Mercurial
What's wrong with inconsistent
Something like unreliability
Malleability is kinda cool because its similar to volatility but with a greater connotation of active manipulation
I think untrustworthiness works but theres hopefully a better word
Malleability?
Murkiness could be between ambiguous and variable but I dont think it applies here
And I was trying to comment on like the effect of looking at a partial story

Okay for context I had this comic and the left half of it
Hmmm
Uncertainty
Inconsistent
I think I want a word between ambiguous and variable
But that even without any change your perception of it is  unreliable
Inconsistency
Like not just that they change
Instability
I was trying to say the ______ of narratives
Variable?
Something like volatility but that isnt right
Whats the word for the quality thats the opposite of being fixed / set in stone

can you be a human from another planet
If ET came into existence on earth which he arguably did conceptually he would not be an alien
Well isnt being an alien like entirely about where youre from and not what you are
everyone being aliens except humans and animals and trees is kind of unfair
does that mean star wars is only aliens
Not yet
Star Trek never happened
or anything else set in the future
Star Trek isnt real
how do we know that star trek happened
How else would we know that it happened
wtf how is it the past
In a galaxy far far away yes
wait is star wars a long time ago
They're from a galaxy far far away a long time ago
You could argue theyre more human than we are
or like luke
is rey a human
Is anyone in Star Wars not an alien

It's the canonically most wonderful time of the year

That might mean that Chinese luck is more like fortune while English has luck and fortune
because having a plane of luck is so messy for no reason
If I understand it correctly in Chinese you always have the same amount of luck, which makes sense
but in Chinese I think there's only good luck and bad luck which made me question the English model
see this whole problem exists because we scale luck in 2 ways in English
unlucky should only be the range of relatively neutral luck
Luck's default form is good
but if you have a lot of it, isn't it a lot of luck
It's unlucky
is bad luck lucky
math is blue because that's the color of my face when the teacher is done choking me out for my incompetence

Javascript be like
C is Red
suffering

Computer shcience
i also fuck with good suffering
Oh no wonder i failed lol
Computer Science is math dude lol
Thao u are not telling me u dont fuck with a good matrix
code = suffering = red matrices = suffering = red
Code is computer Science
Blue is something I associate with warmth and whatnot
english could also be red cause it's your teacher writing illegible comments and then it says C at the top of your paper
Like green is just this intelligent good color
Green is like...code and...matrices
why does no one besides leon think that math is red cause it's suffering and like a guy whipping you while you're down
Science is plants and green
Math is cold and calculating and blue
What makes math green
Red pen marking up my shitty essay in 9th grade lmao
English is def red
math blue for life
Math is like so green lmao
I cant see math as blue tho
Education in general is like green or blue
What a horrible color for a subject
Idt any subject is red lol
Math is BLOOD
I think science is green but math is more green than science
Biology is definitely blue, chem is green as shit tho
(I dont have synesthesia)
Ive voted
and their word would be law
maybe people who have synesthesia that makes them associate words with colors should vote on this
wait maybe
biology = green chemistry = green physics = ??????   science is green

Science is green tho?
Math is green wtf
Valid
eh i'd put either english or social studies as purple
Math is blue, science is green, english is red, social studies is yellow, change my mind
i associate math with red cause its like losing points
English is yellow
Math is blue science is green
If you don't think math is blue ohmwygawd

Im gonna enter
It and banking are like GG
It is theoretically as hard as something can get
The airline industry is the worst market to enter
I guess in like oligarchy places they can be govt operated but really privately owned
I just know most of the western world they are government owned
But yeah, it could depend on country
No they tend to he gov
Maybe that depends on the country
Are airports privately owned/operated
Which means bartering vs other airlines
You have to buy gate access
Yeah, pretty much if im not mistaken
Like 7 or 12?
Like I guess clearly you would need to get approval from all countries you want to operate in but do the airlines also request slots at airports or what
How many airlines have planes in jfk
Yeah that's probably the most perfectly saturated market at all times
I wonder what the process for starting an airline company is like

Why did he allow every year to have 2 winters
actually having 4 seasons and 10 months would be so bad
And if he did
How did he know
he did know like he stole days from the other months
So in the long run he was probably doin us all a favor
But it's not like caesar knew that when he added the 2 months necessary for that to be accurate
So it takes 12 months for the earth to revolve around the sun right

so i guess you can't uncook anything besides protein
when you cook an egg, the proteins get denatured and then form back together different and what the guy did was unfold them so they folded back together in their default configuration which uncooked them
This is the raw version

who's gunnthra?
exc....excuse me
Is the process to uncooking an egg specific or can they eventually do it on gunnthra
I can hope
Let's go convicted felon

The short story illustrates the narrator, Annie informing the reader of her lover, Ben, who is, as she says "experiencing reverse evolution." As Ben gets closer to becoming a one-cell organism, Annie reaches her limits and decides to free Ben into the ocean. The story ends with her forever remembering her lover, hoping that one day he'll come back.
This almost happened to me during no nut November last year
Ben is Annies lover and the man who goes through reverse evolution. During the narrative Ben is morbid, which is probably because Ben, like Annie thinks too much; he realizes this and questions it. As Ben says Were all getting too smart. Our brains are just getting bigger and bigger, and the world dries up and dies when theres too much thought and not enough heart. A day before Ben goes through his reverse evolution track; he realizes that there is no space for anything but dreaming. That maybe people should stop thinking all the time and for a while, follow their heart, and dream. It could be assumed, that Ben tried to stop thinking, but for him it was too much. In the end, it seems the only way Ben can finally stop thinking was to regress into primitive forms, to stop being human.

What's the funniest thing someone could do extremely fast for comedic effect


Reminder happening now.
I like having last year's chat preserved as a snapshot of those who made it
but personally

That was probably the height of my power
I started having a sex dream on like the 27th last time but I woke myself up
We lost the ledge
If we win this year the prize would be being added back
We lost the privaledge
I think it should be a new chat
what if rahul's still continuing his streak
wait so are we gonna be added back
Like we cant control not dying as well as we can control not nutting
Okay Ive died in my dreams before but like dying is a state of person
just dont dream fuck 6Head
Like die
Nah I've done things I didn't want to in my dreams
just dont dream 5Head
If you dream of fucking you can always stop fucking
You dreamed a dream
I argue dreams insert the person into a situation or world or state but the person is still the person
You didn't give in to anything
What if you dreamed you fucked them
Like just because I dreamt of being surrounded by girls doesnt mean I have to give in to them
Look we can get into a whole metaphysical debate about this
i feel like i can't control what i do in my dreams
isn't that lucid dreaming
Just not what you dream of
No its different because you have agency in your dreams
that's like telling someone "shouldnt have been asian"
and my imagination was strong
He could have not nutted in the dream
my body was weak
He shouldnt have nutted in his dream
that's fucked
Yes
wait sj left cause he nut in his sleep
You wont
So just never sleep
Actually lets just say the grace period is until you sleep
Fuck it, nutting at dawn
And once its sunshine you fucked
But you have to survive longer
First night nuts can get rolled back
There is a grace period
Dont sad react I wanna go out with a bang
I didnt even last until november in that chat
Calling it now
Im getting out at 11/1/2019 12:00:00 AM
dude after sj left i had no more motivation
I have no knowledge of the chat
wait can we be add back into the chat
Im over 1000 images behind how do I catch up in one day
Omg omg I forgot about NNN
the runback
i want a round 2
I see that now
homo sapiens were meant to nut
you have to give those who've fallen a chance to rise again
not again
I don't want to inflict the pain of the later half of the month on anyone
and I believe in our grand leader
Sam you don't understand
At this rate November will cum
Allen needs to make the chat
You want it
wtf is wrong with you
Why don't you just make the chat
Allen if you make the chat I swear I will last until the later half of the month
i wont fail you again allen
man I remember Isaac's presence really strongly but he was gone on the 6th
well it would still be classic
Justin died in the backstory
i feel like i should try again cause i failed last time but it'd mean so little if i win cause it's like easy casual but everyone else is playing maddening classic
wow i lost way earlier than i thought
Justin at 10/31 


You're the only one who can!
Sam is getting too healthy
Dont drag me out of Valhalla
Allen you have to make the chat
you can have sex and not nut
It's nut tho
Wait are you allowed to have sex
Im not strong enough to survive again
Idk if I should make the new one
the old chat is alive
But were all weak
If only someone could invite us all back to the og chat
yo like old times sake
MAKE THE CHAT ALLEN
YOU HAVE TO ALLEN
ALLEN MAKE THE CHAT

Ultimately arent we just barnacles to fate anyway
barnacle boy
Being a barnacle would be alright
What evolution
Why do they need feathers
Ew ew ew
Thats shookening
Wait barnacles have feathers?
What if instead of having baggage we had barnacles
And grandma is killing my vibe
I like being able to control my own pace
So it just looks like theyre chasing me hahaha
Sometimes when i sense people behind me speeding up to pass me i start speeding up too
But like it's only certain times
Why do we feel the need to speed up when we're walking behind someone
It's like drafting behind someone in mario kart
Like I become the very thing I meant to destroy
And sometimes this causes me to push past someone or cut someone off which feels somewhat Shakespearean
But especially in New York theres frequently the situation where clearly the most considerate option is to speed up instead of slowing down
I feel like as pedestrians were usually pretty good about being polite and deferring to others
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong
Im doing no nut
Its interesting how a lot of words inside other words arent super obvious
it's like meow and homeowner
Well they are pronounced similar? Atleast i pronounces heater and theater the same p much
is that a problem
The whole word heater is in theater
I want to try if we're doing the chat survival thing again. Otherwise I'm honking the pud as per usual
Anyone doing no nut November this year
a deleted tweet
Should it be a comment, quote tweet, or its own tweet
But the real question is
Like I just wanted to turn Kill to Kit then add Kat

The fact that Snoop replied without delay that the country code for the Czech Republic, is probably not even close to the most wack statement you can read on Wikipedia puts the world into perspective
As the country dial-code of the Czech Republic is 420 and the rate of cannabis use there is one of the highest in the world,[77][78] some foreign visitors think that cannabis is legal in this Central European country. However, those smoking cannabis outdoors will be fined and possessing more than 10 grams of marijuana is considered a crime.[79] In 2016, Snoop Dogg displayed his knowledge of marijuana on the game show, The $100,000 Pyramid. Snoop replied without delay that the country code for the Czech Republic is 420.[80] He would later use the number as one of the dollar amounts in the "Face the Devil" bonus round of his 2017 reboot of the classic American TV game show The Joker's Wild.
Signs bearing the number 420 have been frequently stolen. In Colorado, the Colorado Department of Transportation replaced the Mile Marker 420 sign on I-70 east of Denver with one reading 419.99 in an attempt to stop the thievery;[65] however, the folklore of the 419.99 sign has caused it to be stolen, too, as well as becoming a tourist destination. As of August 2018, the sign was missing, presumed stolen.[66] The Colorado DOT usually will not replace signs that are repeatedly taken, but began the practice of replacing further down the road after 69 mile marker signs were frequently stolen  these were replaced with 68.5 mile ones.[67] The Idaho Department of Transportation (ITD) replaced the mile marker 420 sign on U.S. Highway 95, just south of Coeur d'Alene, with mile marker 419.9.[68] The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) implemented similar measures,[69] but only replaced one of the two 420 signs in the state, with the remaining one being subsequently stolen.[67] According to the Washington Post, there are eleven 420 mile markers in the US, after three replacements and one stolen and not replaced.[70] In Goodhue County, Minnesota, officials have changed "420 St" street signs to "42x St".[71] The mile marker 420 sign on U.S. Route 89, the only 420 marker in the state of Utah, is frequently stolen.[72]
Lol wtf
Have people gotten high since the dawn of mankind
If something was shook, something needs to shake
Its like Newtons third law
the shookening is also the event of shookening
Because i would say something like shooketh and not feel weird about it
Shook is both a state and an action right?
I would go with shookening
that fsmash was shookening
But you must have been shook by something which shakes in some capacity
Like "that shit got me shook"
This question makes no sense because the way you use shook in conversation prevents it from happening

Shooky
What about

shookening
Is something that makes you shook shooking, shaking or like turbulent

Reflect on that
Also i read this as food for cloud
Whether in smash or in the real world its weird to reflect on yourself sometimes since you also have to judge how much its worth reflecting on it
I actually think a lot about this stuff
A real world example btw is that a lot of people end up consistently late because of mta fuckery and in the moment it never feels like your fault but really you need to establish whether youre consistently operating on a timeline where any minor incident will cause you to be late
Food for 
But it really is difficult to dismantle the conceptions you build up
Which is troubling because again not just in smash but in real life theres so many instances where we do the objectively wrong thing but we dont learn because we feel like its more the worlds fault than our own
Like, no matter how many times I die for trying to punish something safe on shield, Ive never felt like it was my fault
Probably partly because of the game itself and partly just because of my mentality being poor
I started thinking about this because I realized that my sense of responsibility in Ult specifically is much worse than it was in previous games
So I think that if you can examine instances in which you gauge responsibility incorrectly, it would be a huge benefit toward improving and not stagnating
And in many instances simply incorrect
And in practice the line is much blurrier and more arbitrary than I would have thought
But if you trip in Brawl theres minimal culpability, so theres no need or reason to activate the learning part of your brain
So for example, if you do a bad roll and get punished, you were responsible and if I realize that allows me to slightly learn toward not repeating that specific error
Have you ever applied this in real life and thought about how much people john
I mean I guess that exists in regular life too but in smash its like directly tied to whether or not you adapt
whenever anything bad happens I subconsciously decide if I should feel any responsibility for what happened
Something I noticed somewhat recently about smash is the idea of culpability
The billion form of thousands
?
a bhousand
but there are times where pikachu has overused his power and has lost his electricity for a while
because I think its more like an innate limiter that stops Pikachu from overexerting itself
going by anime standards yes
But his output is also higher so is Pikachus control just using less electricity
Because the reason Pichu takes damage is his control is supposed to be worse, right
Could pikachu be as strong as pichu if he wanted
yeah not surprising
Tldr it's waterboarding

Haiti took so many white man related Ls it was so sad
My freshman seminar was about Haiti
You could literally substitue Australian for anything and it would be on course
Sounds about white to me
its probably gonna just stay that way
so far the whole class is just how white people ruined native australian lives
I think theyre close to australia and are of the same austronesian people group
Damn the world is literally so connected

what a mistake
im currently taking cultures and context about indigenous australians
Cultures and Contexts: Egypt of The Pharoahs: The China

Or should I say
I took Egypt of the Pharaohs
Lmaoo how the old asian guys screwed over other asian guys
we can learn about how china colonized everyone
All the history classes i ever took in life taught me about old white guys that screwed over other non white guys
I wish i took an Asian cultures and contexts at nyu lol
It was kingdom of the Viet established after repelling chinese rule in around 1000 AD   Dai Viet Dynasty (Great Viet)
Allen just saw tonkin and now he's talking to them
Actually it makes sense considering there are other ethnic minorities that live within the whole of Vietnam
yea viet is an ethnicity
Whatchu tonkin about
Whats tonkin
? Lol ?
Imagine being New Mexican
Yo Tonkin
Housla
I think names peaked at Newfoundland

West Virginia sounds like a joke name
Based on what im reading the term Viet is something of an ethnic term like how i imagine Han chinese is a thing.   Additionally the word Viet itself is something of a patriotic word that was used in naming the state when not under foreign administration.
Ive read canto is in some ways more similar to vietnamese japanese korean because its closer to middle/old chinese than that of mandarin
vietnam is on almost the same sad/bad name level as west virginia
Yeah
Mandarin?
Its nan in Chinese
isaac south
Nam also means south in korean
North south
vietnam means like "south" in viet like when ur own countrys name suggests that some other country is the important one :(
What if the universe is both here and there
How do we know
The universe is between here and there
Not just in the middle between here and there
For china though the name middle kingdom was some sort of implication that China was the center of the universe
Take that back
Ba sing se
But in Chinese you still have to  literally say Middle Kingdom
But theyre not in modern English so they seem like theyre just names
Like I think a lot of state names are just literal meanings
It explains everything
Watch legend of korra episode 19
I suppose thats how a lot of places are named in real life but it feels a lot better when the societys language advances past the names of its locations
Or building a castle on a mountain and deciding its the mountain kingdom now
I just cant visualize someone choosing to found the fire nation
I was telling someone not to name his kingdoms mountain kingdom and stuff but then I realized I guess it works for avatar
Each contain named places
The earth kingdom, the fire nation, the air nomads, and the water tribe
The fire nation is just what the nation is called
Yep
In Avatar the countries dont have names beyond like the Fire Nation right

There were pipes and other smoking things before advertising
You're basically breathing fire
Smoking looks cool regardless of marketing
Aight hollace

The only thing more powerful would be if Zoro smoked that one time

Probably the coolest smoking moment in the history of fiction
When Sanji tanked Enel I almost instantly became a chain smoker
Right
Yeah now its like they dont give a shit but in a nonetheless cool way
Smoking did this turnaround where its less making people look cool and more making people look depressed or apathetic
The smoker
Theres so much smoking in the joker movie
Unfortunately 
Especially like historical settings I suppose
Yeah its mostly in media now
And then it creates a feedback loop where  Marketing to make smoking look cool Filmmakers having characters smoke because smoking is seen as cool etc etc
I feel like there hasnt been much of that in my lifetime but it still looks cool to me tbh
The amount of money that went behind making smoking look inherently cool is absurd
Marketing efforts
Does smoking look cool inherently, from the residual success of marketing efforts or from the connotations of wanton unhealthiness
Learned today theres A set of islands in the Pacific called Micronesia LOL. Name sounds like a symptom of a bad headache. Its a republic with 607 islands and is mostly affiliated with United States and uses the US dollar as its currency. Population 100,000 ish.

I wrote an article about it in high school
I don't recommend it

They save the planet and known universe on multiple occasions in all those shows
Characters
Wait are you talking voice actors or characters
Or 0.5 JLs if you will
Fluttershy alone can equate like half the justice league
Estelle
Do any of those have better main casts
Or gravity falls
Watch adventure time or steven universe
It has one of the best main casts
I wanna watch MLP
Twilight Sparkle is a horse of science
MLP prides itself on being pretty smart tho i'm surprised they'd do that
The move the pngs
Ohhh right
Celestia and Luna move the sun and moon
Wait where does it say equestria is geocentric
Most of the ones where the sun has a face
Name another
Well I guess a lot of cartoon worlds are
Equestria is geocentric
Like I actually thought thats what it was referring to
No
Isnt that low hanging fruit
Wtf
Other
Like two peas in a pod could be pretty far from each tithed
I thought it meant balls
But like a lot of sayings dont make much sense at the end of the day when taken literally
Well its like an idiom for specific uses, low hanging fruit is good but I think the connotation for it is on this theoretical tree, the fruits that take more effort bear more reward
It is low hanging but a lot of the time the simplest solution is the best one
Like if you said countries 2
the reason why I brought it up is I feel it should be a good thing
but it's almost always used the way you said
it can definitely be a good thing in the usage thao is describing
eh it depends on the connotation
Like you shouldnt be proud because it was easy
Its said as a bad thing
it's like the easiest thing you can do
at least it is when i hear it at work
wait what??? isn't low hanging fruit a good thing???
I think you mean oxygen
Worms were clearly meant to be like cellular creatures but the denizens of Smite allowed them to get way too big
One of us is about to expand
Tbh i dont remember. This is like, 5th grade science so i could be completely wrong LOL
Worms make so little sense as entities
How do worms get into trees
Also, fruit rots on the ground cause of decay and shit and that decreases im severity moving up if im not mistaken
Its easier for the worms to jump towards
Cause if a worm is gonna get into an apple its more likely to be lower cause its closer to the ground
Why?
Ye, like apples especially
Wait really?
But its supposed to mean its the like, most likely to be rotten one, or the one with the least amount of work i guess. Cause like, on a tree fruit lower down is more likely to have like, worms
So the phrase has a pretty negative connotation which I think isnt warranted because in many cases the low hanging fruit is the most sensible option to pick
I dont remember it
Did we discuss low hanging fruit in this chat before
Like in codenames
Its pretty interesting how that is a factor in some games and not others
Probably the biggest difference is the FGs dont have natural rubberbanding
They feel super similar to playing fighting games except my mechanics dont usually get exposed
Card games are a lot of fun to think and talk about
I had to play hundreds of hs games before I understood it decently so it seems premature for anyone to be identifying optimal lines of play unless theyre legit card game vets
I have no idea if the game will end up being good or healthy but like
Yeah thats what Im saying too
its pretty early to tell
yeah thats what im sayin
that they always have the answers and the questions
K Rool stomped people
they have so much removal and good units and spells
the yasuo stun deck or the jinx draven aggro deck stomp people
and are generally only swung by like a few key cards
what i mean to say is that more often than not matches feel a bit one sided
I mean how many decks can really be broken concurrently though
so the data might be skewed
however a lot of decks are broken and offer very little opportunity for counter play
like the first thing you think to do is generally pretty good if not the best thing you could have done
his main point is that turns are generally faster because your action is pretty obvious
Where did I go wrong
I cant believe my son said its easy to play Runeterra optimally
declare your role
Im disputing it
also rip the riot games logo
whoaaa

He said league of legends was an MMORPG and I couldn't really dispute it
I had this discussion with Lonesome in middle school
I feel like a better term than rpg could have caught on
Yeah
you know theyre making a shooter and a fighter right
one sec
you didnt watch the stream?!
What rpg
blitz had cool abilities
i'm actually super excited for the league rpg
oooh i've played time mechanic platformers before theyre fun
Imagine if you had to witch time a projectile so you could jump on it
And witch time would be a cool mechanic in a platformer
can she tho
She can also dair
why would it have to be bayo
bayo just has multiple air dashes
You could make custom stages in smash I guess
Platforming with Bayo though
they should make a break the targets but just for bayo
a more combat-centric celeste would be dope
Moving as bayo is fun until you stop
dont we all
And an overarching quest to find a McGuffin
I hope they have vehicle auras
smash
is moving as bayo fun in sash
Like a Celeste
making star maps and circumnavigating the universe
I feel like Bayo could have a good platformer game
imagine the first astrographers
Astrography will probably be a thing one day

is there a tier list of all the ways bayo travels
if you stand still, are you moving astrographically cause the earth is spinning
maybe astrographic
i guess it'd be like heliographic
Is the moon geographic
does she go to the moon
lets say geographically tho
i legitimately dont know enough about the bayo games to answer
Or on the tier list
Physically or spiritually
also epona
how far does bayo travel
what brigid and dagda are celtic gods?????????
Bayonetta Odyssey
Super Mario DMC
Hell kingdom
what about konohamaru
Is odyssey 2 just going to be religious maps
jk rowling is too powerful
wait i never realized knockturn alley is nocturnally and pensieve is pensive sieve
Super Mario Ulysses
Are they going to stop after 2 more
https://smite.gamepedia.com/Gods
Sobek
Nasus
Nut
Morpheus and Guan Yu
whos your favorite god
I couldnt translate it into comprehensible English
I think Ulysses could be the hardest book to translate
love that guy
Harry Nguyen
harry potter and the command of the fire bird
The Vietnamese translation, which was originally published in instalments, originally interpreted "Order" as a directive and translated it as "Harry Potter v Mnh lnh Phng hong"; when it became clear that "Order" referred to a group of people, the title was changed to "Harry Potter v Hi Phng hong"

Lol in one translation of Voldemorts name a w had to turn into 2 Vs in the name reveal
Sum Dux Voldemort
wow this looks like the hardest thing to translate in all history
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_in_translation#Issues_in_translation


I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita...
My Mario and game 3
this is so funny omg
https://xkcd.com/2198/




It's interesting how a pet without their collar looks particularly naked even though theres practically no difference in their usual appearance
all directions are expansion
My relative grade standing and my overall maturity moved in opposites if anything
I feel like brain expansion is more life experiences than school
high school was the sucko part for me
Worst arc
Part Skipping Middle School
college is the dlc
elementary school middle school and high school are the base game because you get in trouble for not going
that's basically college
brain dlc
imagine brain expansion packs
LOLOL
What a powerful word

No cap
But hes the greatest pocket qb of all time
Fuck tom brady

samus jab 1 to samus jab 2
Kazapp into kafrizz
krool downthrow into magic burst
Pshoooo
Into megaman fsmash
Holy shit zss Nair nairdodge read with holy water
Is it better to have holy water than flip kick
I'll go zelda if you go bowser jr
It's like league
And it might happen to you
It like might happen in doubles
Isnt it wild that all of this and more just exists in doubles
Bayo downb to ganon neutral b
Wait how about g&w up b to galaga to guest f side b 1
Witch time c4 to Fox illusion misinput
Megaman can press side b again to detonate
is ike bthrow to great aether still a combo
Mortar sticky c4 wouldn't that be crazy
Can you rob side b after g&w up b
Focus attack armor into magolors up down attack from star allies
what if you just got laddered by ike nair to krool up b
*puff roll out
Ike nair to krool bair to gw up b to yoshi egg
Who plays all 3 of those characters
Probably better but iunno
It has armor
is it better than incineroar and ridley dsmash
Bruh upper middle class at the very least
Krools dsmash is a middle class mans spot dodge
Remember when g&w bair was the best move in brawl
Megaman?
And specials tbh
Maybe you should just have all g&w smashes
Wait is g&w dsmash better than wolfs
Like tomb raider
2 clown carts
Bowser jr up b and zelda up b at the same time
buster monado ken
Zelda up b to pikachu down b
Or pikachu down b
Like reverse zelda lol
Hit 1 of bowser jr up b to hit 2
Wait is this best theoretical combos of different characters moves
snake dthrow at 160% to waft
Diddy already does that
Ike nair to diddy banana
Wait zss nair to lucario up b
The ario combo
What kinda horseshit andy lol
Mario dair to dr mario downb to wario up b to lucario up b
he marries a girl who needs weed to tell her what to do
Bowser Jr is married???
They really took some dude who married a dirt hobo and gave him the best jab in the game smdh
chrom jab to doc down b
Palu jab to bair
Id not have a main crisis
Palu with Chrom jab would actually nuke this game
Zss nair to piranha plant down b
Jabbing on peoples shieldnfrom behind them is so satisfying
Chrom jab 
chrom with chrom jab
That sounds toxic
any character with chrom jab
Krool with Roy Nair


yoooooo all krool
allen no

imagine hocus pocus slow down + witch timed + shield monado cloud
W
While were here I might as well reveal the true ideal moveset
im getting edgeguarded then switch to jump art with clouds smash 4 dair
Imagine speed monado limit cloud
imagine falco side b to ivy uair or something
Monado
Imagine limit mondo
PSHOOOOOO
You could def contextualize all of them
big daddy monado
Chrom with Rob's specials actually
Give me chrom with roller actually
Wait what would limit neutral b do for cloud with monado
I was thinking just hisnjumps and if he side bs he gets another jump
If it was g&w up b though
g&w definitely best up b
But you'd never be in shield
His oos would be horrible
2%
Chrom with inkling recovery would actually be ban worthy
buster finishing touch
Inkling jumps like Jordan
Why inkling recovery
give me smash 4 cloud with monado arts
yea i'd vote palu fair
ALSO palu fair best fair
yea i was thinking maybe inkling but also we're trying to build a char out of moves, not pick the best moves
We already agreed on Isabelle bair
Chrom kit with Inkling recovery
AS A BAIR
Shits literally -3
Wait how is inks bair not the best bair
it's like links nair but better
guest f nair
That shit is -2
Smash 4 cloud
ok but what would you guys have as an ideal character
Imo it's link Nair
it's definitely not zss nair i just wanted justin jones to react to that message
Zss nair is safe af
The best part of zss nair is flip kick
Snakes nair is like 3 different aerials
yea imo snake nair is way worse than it looks
Zss nair op tho
Snake nair def isnt
Why are snake and zss nairs in this conversation wtf
jk zss nair the best nair
80% of a dog secretary
palu nair is definitely the best nair
Okay like if you take just Isabelle bair you added 80% of a character to yours
What about snake or palu nair
Enzalada
Zelada's Fair
Zelda fair?
We're converging

It would cancel first, so no hitbox, rhen if both mashed it wouldndonit again, thennthe third time it would break
??? LOL
LEON

But it rarely does
also i think krools belly would just break lmao
ok but if you were building the best char out of moves
If there was a dash attack contest palu and krool would win no?
ohhhh that makes sense, i didn't know he was intangible
Warios is better than all of these
like his head is palus shield
Snakes is intangible so it might as well be better palu dash attack
also snakes dash attack basically loses to nothing anyways
Light mode it burns
i think snakes is just so much bigger than palu that it's still better
?

But palu and krools have armor
- @Edward Cheung
snake dash attack is way bigger
yea def imo
Or krools
As long as you cover your neutral and confirm options with the rest of your kit, being able to fit in a unique zoning tool into your normals is really good
Is snakes dash attack better than palus
Mario and Luigi bair?
yea falco bair is a good answer, idk if i could think of a better bair
I would say Isabelle bair isnt the best but it adds a lot of value to a kit as a standalone move
If I were to guess Eds reasoning
like daisy dtilt into wolf bair
Or falco bair
what about wolf bair
there's no way isabelle bair is the best bair
Wait explain ISABELLE BAIR
Explain Zelda neutral b
Imagine?
imagine mac dtilt into knee
?
Nice cover up
sonic fsmash
He just picked the best move for each move
Why bair and isabelle
I cant keep this information contained
Jab: Bowser Jr. Utilt: Falco  Ftilt: Chrom Dtilt: Daisy Usmash: Fox Fsmash: Chrom Dsmash: Wolf Dash Attack: Snake Nair: Wario Uair: Fox Fair: Zelda Bair: Isabelle Dair: Ivysaur Neutral B: Zelda Up B: G&W Side B: Snake Down B: ZSS

yeah i get what you're saying
Like if you have sexual romantic and co-caregivers but no domestic, why
Which is interesting
I suppose in a lot of cases its the platters you dont have which shape the relationship
Although
It might be a useful writing exercise to pick a random mix and write a scene about two people with that type of relationship
Damn I was gonna say imagine sexual without physical but I suppose thats just Omegle
if we don't take every platter she isn't the one
i have no idea how this works
this is like a way wholesome version of love languages

Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of eight children from their mother Dorothea (Ne Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed their fathers footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After down-sizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in Kassel. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.[1]  Shortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class.
The Grimms brothers backstory sounds like a Grimms brothers fairy tale

I cant see that emoji

Why are teeth so thicc


Wait which chat was the wasp in
https://twitter.com/mrmctwig/status/1184265461615214597?s=17
Its okay a good amount of people dont have wifi yet
The canonical time period is probably world war 1
The present might have ended
idk if anyone has it on their phone yet cause i saw one guy with it
the google duplex thing is max future
Thats the future
Like my Monday alarm tried to disable itself for Columbus Day
Maybe Im getting old but Ive been increasingly shook by what technology does recently
I'd assume it was paper but that is innately ignorant I agree
What if you discovered what appears to be a paper cut on you, but dont know that it was caused by paper
I'm a cut liberal
I would say that I got a plastic cut at that point
I want to be a material liberal but I can't imagine a scenario where I'd state I got a paper cut from plastic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUlHhrL_Zj8
You can imagine its special paper
That would be like if you get killed by a paper sword
like what would a material purist but depth liberal look like
like what if paper glided really smooth through you and you got cut in half
I think Im a depth purist but a material liberal
Yaseen is in the double purist corner
It's not paper
I feel like at that point you got cut
Same thats why I brought it up
i got paper cut by plastic before
Is it more important than the material you get cut by
The cut
Or the paper
Oh did you mean the depth of the cut
The severity of the injury is too
I feel like depth is pretty important
Nah
It you get decapitated by a tree does it count
If you ripped off some skin with a post it does that count
Im down to get embroiled in a chart sandwich chart discussion but can we address paper cuts first
I'm pretty sure both sandwich charts and alignment charts have chaotic evil sections
I mean its a tic tac toe chart too
That's an alignment chart too
3x3
How big is a sandwich chart implied to be
Wait first off
There could be a sandwich chart of injuries that qualify as paper cuts
it makes the emotional decay fast
Which makes the time decay much slower I think
But simpler because you dont have to account for the reasonability for anyone except the one person
Holding a door open for people is a similar problem
It may be more practical to plot as many points as possible of reasonable time/people combinations and then  get the function from that
Idk it seems complicated
I think as a baseline function you could use something like t(x) = C / (x + 1)
The question isnt whether the door will be held, its what the reasonable amount of time to wait for the Xth person is
ok like i feel like if 1 person in the party wants to hold it open then you only need 1 and it'll be held open
like in the original question, you were the one who just walked in right
That doesnt really matter though
Why would it be
isn't it up to the newest person how much to wait tho
Like, maybe youre willing to wait 10 seconds, but after the first person is there it only takes 5 seconds for you to collectively wait 10 seconds
I think the key might be the aggregate amount of waiting
I think the distance divides by half each time
Dabuzs Yorick
the elevator party*
So I wonder about the specifics of the scaling
And if while that person approaches, someone else appears, I feel its implicitly understood that the elevator will wait if the new person is within a slightly smaller range
I might have already brought this up but if you get into the elevator and see someone else coming theres a certain distance within which youll hold the door right

the most cursed status code
omg 402 Payment Required
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
There is also code 200 which means no error
I think that one is 505 or something
The access denied one is a banger too
425 Too Early
Are you saying dk country music is bad
the other ones are wack
damn 404 is the Bramble Blast of error codes
Error 418 I'm a teapot
I recognized it by Chriss proximity at a late hour
just think of it as the game where chris has been stuck on one boss for a year
Ive never heard of it til now
I only recognized it by the bar at the bottom
i know OF wings of vi and i think i'd recognize it if i saw a screenshot but not in a picture in windowed mode from various feet away
Its definitely at a point where if you dont know you are doing something wrong
thanks yaseen you always come in clutch
Wings of Vi
no seriously
Wait what
The same one
wait what game is chris playing there

Paul Bunyan is in fgo
Knack is the only real one man army
Because you can accurately call any main person in a dynasty warrior game a one man army even though they have armies
I think its ratio based
1 man 2 armies
A one man armies
Well that might be a half man army and a regular guy
And their combined ki was exactly twice the sum of your entire armys
What if you only sense their ki
but then you'd refer to them by name at that point
I suppose it sounds bad to even say that there are two one man armys headed this way
the answer is either 3 or 4
Rabbits cant count past 4 so the number for 5 is 1000
Thats how numbers work in Lapine
like numerically you have 1, 2, 3, and then a lot
like the answer can't be more than 4
Fair enough
ok i'm gonna answer 4 at most
There were like only 2 teams in the battle of the 5 armies
i guess it depends on how they're working together
If goku and vegeta were working together they would still both be one man armies
ok like if 2 armies team up then it's basically 1 army
2
How many one man armies can team up before they lose their statuses

its been done
Would it be inappropriate to commercialize an actually haunted house
they're selling tickets saturday

old man McCoy died there after murdering his wife
But its a little vague
I mean you could just say its a real haunted house
You would need to be able to convey that its real
But if you were saying its a haunted house
i feel like the actual haunted houses probably are referred to by name
I think most worlds with real ones would also have fake ones
i feel like there's never a world with both real and fake haunted houses
Because if you live in a world with real haunted houses I think it would be important
Is there a concise way to distinguish between real and entertainment haunted houses
Emotional safari
Emotional zoo
Emotional cars the ride
emotional haunted house
Emotional Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind
Emotional toy story shooters
Emotional pirates of the Caribbean
After all
Emotional small world
Imagine a bumper coaster
I think it has more to do with conflict and confrontation
Like you go back and forth a lot but between non serious emotions
I think if it as a roller coaster but with no stakes
What is emotional bumper cars
It would be a theme park
I feel like this would be a fun way to theme an amusement park, but at the end of the day it would just be a regular amusement park
I posed the question because roller coasters and bumper cars are existing phrases
Emotional bumper cars
I dont know if theres enough of a distinction in the emotional context
Like the roller coaster but you get wet
Emotional splash mountain
That's like rectangles and squares tbh
Thats a funhouse
Emotional house of mirrors
Well this has been an emotional gondola.
But maybe less theatrical
Yeah lol
Or is that the same as tower of terror
Emotional drop tower 
Pretty straightforward but scary
Emotional gondala
Merry go rounds are but with Ferris wheels youre done after 1-2 revolutions
Nah Ferris wheels arent repetitive
They're hectic but repetitive
Emotional merry go round
Emotional ferris wheel
Oh that one isnt even mysterious
Emotional ring toss
You have a strong reaction to it but partly due to a lack of other viable options
Emotional giant swing
I think an emotional hotdog stand would be like
Emotional tower of terror
Emotional basketball
Emotional hotdog stand
Like if something is an emotional funhouse, it would definitely mean something, but idk what
What would the emotional versions of other amusement park attractions entail
What if images could rhyme
Soldiers of fortune
Kol Tlunimush has been ecstatic lately. He killed somebody by accident while sparring recently. He took joy in slaughter lately. He has lost a lover to tragedy lately. He has witnessed death. He had a satisfying sparring session recently.
Dwarves gain positive thoughts from engaging in slaughter. And that's before insanity drives them berserk. However, as of DF2014, it seems dwarves become horrified by the deaths of anything with tags denoting some form of higher intelligence instead, at least initially before the players actions leave them emotionally dead. This ranges from goblins and other dwarves, down to freaking crundles making it problematic to deal with the emotional fallout. Won't stop disciplined soldiers from bounding into a horde of goblins to bash their brains in, though.
The perpetual motion machine issue actually arises from trying to apply the laws of physics too accurately, while simultaneously trying to bend them in the name of the Rule of Fun. The flow rate of screw pumps is two orders of magnitude greater than it should be for the power applied due to using a one dimensional quantity (liquid depth) as if it were a three dimensional one (liquid volume). Correcting this "This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab.bug," however, would result in the pumps either moving liquids so slowly they would evaporate before reaching a depth greater than 1, or require 100 fully powered water wheels per pump (assuming tiles are 10 x 10 liquid levels in size, as their power generation seems to indicate for a given liquid flow rate). Choosing not to try to think too hard about it seems to be the best compromise for the sake of gameplay, at least until flow rate calculations can be rebalanced.
Dwarf Fortress is one of those things where everything you read about it sounds like satire of itself

And the Flintstones will be the Jetsons
Wait there would be a time when the Jetsons are the Flintstones
There would definitely be some years with horseshoe heelies
Umbrellas
Jetsons
Also imagine what the Jetsens would look like if it had been conceived in each individual year
why don't we have horseshoe heelies
Like I wonder what were the why dont we have a better way to do this yet things of 1800
Its interesting how not only whats modern, but also whats antiquated and futuristic shifts throughout history
excuse me someone mentioned names that are immediate hooks and no one brought up JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
i feel like u could literally calculate it right
Im imagining like if someone jumped up some distance into space, and then went back to his original position
Would the difference be a gradual thing
How big of a difference is necessary to qualify as different
This might be dumb but how far from earth do you have to go before you wouldnt be in the same spot when you go back
It would just be awkward if he sent the message and then is just there
Because you kind of have to die right after saying it
Maybe hes gonna commit crimes
And says he hid it somewhere
Or when he's on his death bed he sends a public message to the world
I feel like his quirky successors would take over while battling for power
I hope he didn't tbh
Did Oda set up plans to reveal what one piece is if he dies
That should be like a national holiday
Antarctica is a pretty fire nickname
Yo the day they reveal what one piece means holy shit
One Piece has no power of its own
Yeah and why is it called Kingdom hearts 3? Its not the third game
Yeah something like birth by sleep sounds weird and cool
devilman crybaby hooked me as a title
Probably Aqua twice
Birth By Sleep is legit tho I still don't understand who was birthed by who's sleep
And the answer is actually so simple but not straightforward at all
A place further than the universe
Dude all I could think when I bought that game was "what does it stand for"
Kingdom Hearts 358 days / 2
Theres at least a universe in which it was a successful hook
Ooh yeah fire force works
Putting aside its effectiveness in the real world
They chose the name in universe as a hook
Doesn't that name just sound like it'd be amazing
Fire Force is currently doing it to me RN
A couple nouns at most
That just looks like a noun
Fairy Tail
Name one name that hooks just from the name
Just knowing the name One Piece isnt going to draw people in
Yeah but you dont know that until you start watching it
The first chapter says gold roger left his treasure and called it one piece
slime
animes nowadays have such long names like milfsekai
The first episode literally explains
i definitely asked myself like "one piece of what" many times in my childhood
You have to clarify what youre even talking about
OP is like the opposite of a hook
it's the perfect mix of like nice and weird english
What is the one piece
The first and absolute hook of anime
It's a hook
my hero is a great name
OPs name has only hampered its success
Would one piece be successful if it were called Luffy
Dattebayo
Borutos Dad
What would you name the naruto manga besides naruto
The only world that's actually big is one piece
Yeh
As someone who watched and read naruto and knows about its lore in depth
it's crazy that konoha or something is just one city so the entire naruto is probably way smaller than one country
I believe it
Like, I dont know if it would be in the true reality
Relatively that means we could be a Naruto world compared to a greater reality
I dont think things can be so bad so long as Mt. Rushmore exists
In the grand objective scale we've been doing pretty well overall
Like overthinking that aspect of the universe isnt conducive to anything so we might as well just appreciate Mt. Rushmore
So taking a step back and observing everything from a more objective lens makes me feel a bit better
Or die a villain
Pure innocent and incorruptible
But then I think you could call the world or the universe beautiful or ugly and it would have no substance either way because the human perspective is so limited
You either die a hero
True beauty never lasts
Sometimes I feel like theres so much ugliness in the world and the sheer miasma of overwhelming unpleasantness is so ubiquitous that its certainly in me too which is also troubling
he cloned himself for more votes
Naruto is literally about becoming the president
He literally built the leaf village around it

And created a world around it
It's so funny that kishimoto literally saw mount Rushmore and was like YES
the wokage
Where did you hear SoF that made you think of it
Hokage Benjamin Franklin
Well they're a soldier of the one true king
It would be much more intuitive if the term was soldier for fortune
Not really luck, more like opportunity, which is halfway to money actually
The way I always thought about it was like, since theyre mercenaries, they end up working for whatever fortune takes them
Soldier of Fortunate Circumstance
Thats a banned word in this chat
Duh
Omg the fortune in soldier of fortune is money, not luck
google meme search is so bad
But i can't find this meme or the video of the guy speaking in anime japanese
I have vaguely described so many things in the google search bar and found them lol
Shouldnt the vastness contribute to the difficulty of specificity
Yet it's impossible to look up something so specific sometimes
Dang it's pretty crazy that the internet is so vast and limitless
And what is its origin
Whats the meme called though
Antman
Nezuko
Ohhh i interpreted your "once more" incorrectly lol

Lilina for one
Who can turn into babies
Once more duo units come out Lilina and someone else can turn into babies
The phrasing felt inaccurate but I didnt know what else to say lol
Sometimes they turn into plushies
It's not necessarily visual quality
Whats the name of the meme where 2 people say hi and then drop in visual quality
The effect


I think that means my body took an internal screenshot
I just sneezed and farted at the same time
also to monkeys
to humans
Also monkey has a negative connotation
I was going for neutral
Oh that's my b
The horse looks mad
Why
Negatively
Do you perceive this image negatively or positively

did the teacher do the reading
only
Damn on the writer did the reading
Id like to draw attention the use of looke and not look as if he is drawing on a past time
if only allen's nickname was both byleths in this chat too


I'd like to call attention to the thought Colon put into selecting his words so that each line is shorter than the last, implicitly reinforcing the theme of a setting sun, but would anyone else like to share their analysis?

Today we are going to discuss "The Last Sun," by Christopher Colon.
Hello class. Did everyone remember to do the reading?

Now we must look inward
The time for growing outwards has passed
Can you PLEASE add Falln to this chat so theres someone on your expansion level
Its like a fleeting taste of paradise
it's a shame i have to take his son
i love allen
And shaking it in a public space projects competence even if youre not accomplishing anything like when you pretend to inspect vegetables
However the act of the stamping itself is performed by the employee so the act of shaking it is your designated role in the process
Because in the first place, making progress on a stamp card feels good especially for gamers because youre collecting something / moving forward in a gamified way
Because its actually a rare intersection of positive feelings and lasts a really short time, so the entirety of the action is the initial burst of pleasure
I think waving a stamp card to get it to dry is one of the most enjoyable things anyone can do
I dont know if the responsibility of generating the next layer belongs to the first you or the immediately previous one
Maybe you can actually
Isaac Nam added Allen Wu to the group.
Allen Wu left the group.
Omg what if Im just a layer
I got to the second layer and dipped
Okay I tried it and you cant
Can you fantasize about exactly what youre doing
for like 30 minutes then i get off
uh i don't know if it's the right way to do running but i alternate between 5 minutes of sprint and 5 minutes of brisk walk
I never really thought about it much but I feel we all build up a bunch of rituals over time
What exercise / running habits do you guys have
Either way people wanna be as far apart as possible after factoring in the quality of the individual stalls
It doesnt matter if there are walls
what if there was one long toilet like a bench
but like a row of toilets without walls
Stalls are a row of toilets
are u talking about like stalls or like just a row of toilets
Really it should be toilet rules but its less visible
I think toilets definitely apply
Elevators
Ports
does toilet really apply then
Go the max minimum distance from people
what are the rules
Toilets
subway seats
sitting at the cafeteria
1. Treadmills
Which things follow urinal rules
No one tell @Paul Merritt
You know you cant say Colorado on YouTube without getting demonetized
the only 2 objects on earth

I love wrestling
omw to nasa
Bowser side b
You could probably throw someone out of orbit
oh wait wrong chat
what would wrestling on the moon be like
in scripted wrestling yeah but it's scripted anyway so??? but in wrestling wrestling it's real
I committed the mystery
It's like he just solved a mystery but hasn't told anyone yet
If i had to describe how allen talks
If you had the same profile picture I'd have no idea who was who
Damn i got a phd reading that

You know damn well
wechat will always be the funniest messaging app for some reason
eh I probably would
I would never say unsung advantage wtf
Danny went to jail?
Or falln
wtf chat is that
I wish i could phrase my thoughts like allen


Theyre forces of nature
they have 0 int and all endurance like it's so optimal
Their rate of growth outspeeds any injury or fatigue
They haven't gotten their limiters yet
Yo children have unlimited stamina
I remember from watching rocky I was like why wouldnt you just stand up every time you got knocked down and then I realized that his body is literally using the last of his energy to even remotely stand
True
Well simply latching onto someone adds your weight at least
I thought the act of pinning was more symbolic like start the countdown now kind of thing
Like I didnt know Force was actively being applied
Didnt realize
Oh wait really
Pinning someone is pushing you down with more strength/weight than you're able to lift up
Is it basically like youre lying down cuz your body gave in
Or boxing for that matter
Every move is snake dthrow on you
How could you ever get pinned in wrestling
This is a dumb question but
it takes so many frames to get up when you're at high damage irl
It could just be a reflex
Actually the idea of being forced to stand up isnt that weird
You do tho
Imagine if you got jab reset
kicking a guy when he's down is kind of like a jab lock
does real life have wobbles
Just contorting in agony as you get repeatedly hammered
Getting wobbled by Isabelle in real life would be so messed up
But a toy hammer would have zero hitstun
Isabelle has a wobble now
It depends kind of on where you draw the line between hitstun and merely being in disadvantage
Actually
more things could have armor irl tho
Yes
Yeah
To the proportionate attack?
Does real life have really high hitstun compared to smash
actually that requires another device so it doesn't count
like what if your friend sent you an mp3 and then you put it on your ipod shuffle and heard the message and then you responded by sending them an mp3
actually i guess they can communicate
they also can't communicate
ipod shuffles don't have screens
ok what about a battery
so anything technology you can use while walking
actually apparently cameras are mobile devices
it's never used to refer to things without screens either
mobile device is never used to refer to anything that can't communicate
does it need to communicate to be a device
so it should be a device that you can use while walking and also one that should have some sort of communication function and is above a certain threshold of technological sophistication
ok is a brick mobile
It's so mobile
boomerang for gmail
radios and boomerangs
and it has no screen
is a megaphone a mobile device
a walkie talkie is a mobile device
I'd say a pager is mobile
Nowadays it's things you can use while walking
what about a pager
The definition of mobile definitely changes a bit as time goes on, no?
I think laptops are mobile second and portable first
or at least that's what the tech industry means by "mobile device"
i mean like screen resolution

there are probably laptops smaller than tablets
the thing that matters is the screen size and that's it
or at least how i use "mobile device" at work
what about a tablet with a connectable keyboard
no
what about a laptop
yes
is a tablet a mobile device
His gloves have the most heart
the thing is bowser jr probably has the best boxing glove move but it's not the STRONGEST boxing glove move
I'd also bring up little mac
what about K. Rool
Bowser jr has the strongest boxing gloves in smash 4
seems like an adequately reliable source
isn't that his name in shrek
Is Prince Charming's name Charming
once?
I once killed someone with bowser jr jab
I once killed someone with Ganon jab and they were very unhappy
When I die to moves I think should be weak its such a letdown
And due to Ult kb, the game overall makes deaths feel more reasonable than in previous games
So it kinda benefits everyone involved for moves to feel powerful
Like if you get lightning kicked it feels totally acceptable but dying to like DK utilt feels bad
Isnt it interesting that in smash if a move looks / feels stronger, its not only more satisfying to hit, but also to get hit by
Farbani glyphs

Yeah its fun to see what symbol you can get
that's going on my mantle
THE COVETED ALLEN "WOW REACT"
s
i love just mashing alt code

Also you have to use the numpad
Enter the numbers while holding down alt, and then let go of alt
how do u do alt codes
0151
what's the alt code for that

i need to learn the interpunct middle dot one
idk a single one
M dash?
I only know m dash
What alt codes do you guys know
Like it finds all the graphics in the document
Like clip art?

Did anyone know you can search for images in Word if you ctrl+f ^g
On another topic
damn
It was pretty bad when I saw it like 10 years ago
or if it's still a site where people talk about their problems in like a healthy way
Im pretty sure it fell long ago
i wonder if it's been overrun by incels like alana's site
I wonder if its still active
I remember seeing the loveshy site before incelism was a known concept and it was the weirdest forum Id ever seen
right that too
It sounds like it means people who care but dont want to try
like i didn't know it meant "doesn't really care about getting a relationship"
until i read the definition i thought it was just "men who don't necessarily want to be alpha"
is herbivore men like ace men
well also i don't think i'd be a good partner so that's also part of it
cuz i feel like that's me
is there a term for being thirsty af but can't be assed to hunt for ass
Her name is Alana and she recently started a new project called Love Not Anger
"According to Fukasawa, herbivore men are 'not without romantic relationships, but have a non-assertive, indifferent attitude toward desires of flesh'. The philosopher Masahiro Morioka defines herbivore men as 'kind and gentle men who, without being bound by manliness, do not pursue romantic relationships voraciously and have no aptitude for being hurt or hurting others.'"  i feel like this sort of describes me but also doesn't?
and i think braincels just recently got banned as well
i forgot her name but her website was her name's involuntary celibacy
ye
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore_men
The first incel was a woman
Omg after r/incels got banned there was another subreddit called r/braincels
But its more awkward as an identity / label
Oh wait forever alone might be a superior term
I dont want my growth as a person to be about the word incel
and thus the purpose of this chat is fulfilled
So I take it back
And theres not really another word for someone who just vaguely doesnt have sex or relationships?
Because you can say involuntarily single but all those options seem less accurate since single people can have sex
Okay I thought about it and to be fair, it is a little hard to refer to the idea of celibacy without the choice component
Its too late because its already established but every time we willingly refer to the concept of involuntary celibacy, its a loss for reasonable phrasing
Did I already complain about the term incel here
this is too anti-incel for me
Like all things you just gotta find what works for you
Self help books are helpful but theyre designed to simplify things bc people like making small changes for big results
I think around a year or two ago I fell too quickly into very simple mantras
Yeah I think empathy and respecting yourself is the balance one needs to strike
No need to be out here like some type of Buddha
I think its best to live as if being good is rewarding
Yeah most of that stuff is super unreliable but at least at the end of the day you can save 15% or more on car insurance
You can improve your QoL but a lot of things are out of your control
I think a lot of things I see online in terms of attitude sort of promise this "do this and life will be good" attitude which is just nonsense
Like why did I get cheated on vs I deserve a relationship
Well idk if thats more often
Can you elaborate on what you mean by that
I agree but to be fair its usually invoked more in contexts of not getting punished
Being good shouldnt be something you do looking for a reward for
I just really hate a lot of the "I'm so good, woe is me" attitude I see on social media
Your parents could die no matter how nice you are
Oh shit
Yeah exactly
But thats not the world
People definitely treat you better if youre nice
Cause people prefer not working with assholes
I mean wouldnt it be more self righteous to believe the opposite
Like if someone is thinking of hiring 2 people of the same skill, they'll go with the person who was nicer
It's true but also self righteous and pretentious
This is so false

holy shit
The Andy Bow Effect sent an attachment.
Because Im very behind on recent American movies for obvious reasons
Anything that moves
Is it mostly talk about recent movies

there's a movie's chat?
Anyway who wants to be in the movies chat
Youre good but im better
LOL
a star is born was a little weird
Is this a wolf furry test
Like it really bothered me for almost a week after I saw it
Anyone else like movies and also the moon
I think its thought provoking in a similar way so check it out if you can
I have not
Christian have you seen A Star is Born
?
Yes
Christian do you like movies and also the moon
And it felt unfulfilling
The very end was interesting but before that they seemed to basically achieve their dreams in a time skip
Can you die in la la land
Especially as it relates to being an artist as a career and the journey it can take you on
I think Allen ud provide a good perspective about it
The duality of Californians
I saw the last 30 minutes out of context and was unimpressed but Id imagine you need the whole journey
But it posed a really big life question
I really liked it!
I didnt like the end of la la land

Except for the edgy ones who thought they should have cast actors who can sing/dance
lalaland is so good
Going along with the effect
Theatre kids creamed their pants over that movie
Just as in recently
But the ending really made me think about things
Ok i wont talk about wat i was gonna say bcus spoilers
That one shot musical number omg
I saw the end
I just saw the middle
Wait i just watched the beginning of la la land
Guys i saw la la land for the first time last week and ive been thinking about the ending nonstop
Minecraft is really fun
same all i know is u walk around and it's all green and infinite and you build cubes and dig them away
I wouldnt know
Soooo many ways
wait how do you die in minecraft
Existing in many games is probably worse than death
Falling off the map and moving to 12 is worse than death
And then its like, can your mobility be impeded in any way
If it counts then getting briefly stunned would also be getting knocked out
Like the only thing is you cant move for a few seconds
big brain answer
brain age
can you die in spore
It's a knocked out state
Wait why would falling off count
Maybe its only spider. i dont remember too well
In new leaf bee stings are just a status effect
Is falling off in Mario kart a knocked out state

Like wiping out in pkmn sends u back to a pkmn center
Well no because it sends u back home
Then u have to get medicine
It's just a status effect
Or spider bite
Bees can knock u out
Is animal crossing the only game that has no death or like knocked out state
Yo wonder trade is actually so fun
i made back the money i paid for pokemon Y with dittos
Looool
i used to clone 6IV dittos and sell them online LMAO
Wait does pichu represent johto
heres a really stupid story about that actually
You put it under the pad for endless hatching with your talonflame
i got a 6IV ditto from pokemon cloning with my friend
The penny
Yeah!!
i kept running around lumiose
oh yeah i fiended breeding in my pokemon Y also
Which was every day in high school lol
And i played it every day i waited for the bus
Cause it made ev training easier
i mean what made you play it so much
That's just the one i bought
why pokemon x
What about assist trophies
Yep
Does that include games with miis
I've played pokemon x more than every other smash represented game combined and ninjas are cool af dawg
It is the meaning of things
It doesnt mean anything
Whatever that means allen
Greninja cause it's my core
I removed this pic from my website

LMAO
Do I need to explain that?
@Edward Cheung explain dk
.
Originally I hated cloud
And tbh most of what i look for in a character now is good movement which is why i despise cloud in ultimate
Originally i hated cloud but once i realized how cool his movement was i mained him
I played cloud on FG once in smash 4 for like 2 hours straight and spammed extended dash dance and I got hype
Cloud cause he felt nice and palu cause i get to play smash 4.   Chrom/wolf cause they are cool
But that might have started to change since my secondaries in Ult are Daisy and Inkling
Real talk I do think about this, I very rarely pick top tiers in any fighter despite loving fighting games  I think if I lose with a mid/low tier then I feel less bad than if I lose with a high tier, where I have less excuses for losing. So I wonder how much that factors in sometimes
Incineroar Big
Random cuz theres no character I like playing more than all the other ones. Also no nostalgic or emotional connection to any characters
he needed to be destroyed
now i play pikachu cause i picked him up solely to destroy my brother who mained dk
and then he was so different in s4 so i played cloud
i played marth in every smash game for many years cause i like edgy anime sword bois
And it showed
And then Snake was gone so all I had left was my meme character
Also in the Brawl official strategy guide they demonstrated every move on brown Mario and I thought that was funny so I started playing Mario
I mained Roy in smash 4 bc this one FG Roy applied some wild corner pressure and I wanted in
Thats my entire backstory tbh
I had to main Snake to beat Thaos toon link
Whats everyones reason for maining their characters
When I switch to/from ken peach in a set I can feel the memory leak

It was about his pills always being the same color on the first frame
I learned something about doc recently but I dont remember if it was a dream
Even in smash 4 I felt like it was harder to do really well with Doc but easier to do reasonably well
Mario is a lot harder than doc in ult
ok but my doc is way better than my regular mario though
But they also feel diff. Imagine like yink and tink
Going between Mario and dr mario is alright
Yeah like they feel the same but handle different sounds terrible
i feel like the ones that are hard to switch onto are the ones that are really similar like pikachu and pichu or melee fox and falco
I think like lucina into Roy isnt a bad choice due to like different effective ranges
depending on comfortability
Versa
Id also consider like starting with the character with the better recovery options so that the other person is more conditioned to not edgeguard as aggressively, or vice versatile
But at the same time, most regular combos arent that precise in this game so weight doesnt make a huge difference
I feel like starting the easier character is optimal
FACTS
PT privilege
When you need to adjust your combos between games
Bowser jr is just better cloud
I feel like thats a pretty big factor actually
Maybe like bowser jr and sonic a little?
Or characters that have different weight/float lines properties so follow ups are forcibly different
Characters that depend a lot on fundamentals? Maybe like Mario and Lucina?
What 2 characters are easy to go between playing and hard to go between playing against
Just pick that question mark in the bottom right corner and boom, everyone is disoriented
Going bowser jr 1 game is optimal but you can make an argument for 0 games as well
Its really easy for me to get runover game 1 against something and I feel it applies to a lot of people
Yea maybe but you also never know if someone knows how to fight one character but not another
if you can but like you almost always can't for some pairs of chars
I think its hard to do but if you can do it its like strictly advantageous
Because it can be very hard to switch between two hard characters
I think this is only a strong tactic if one of the characters is easy to play though
I go from cloud to joker usually to practice joker but people usually play a lot worse game 2 vs joker
I actually do this lol
In my set with Chris I was 3-0 in my first game on a character and and 3-7 in games where it wasnt my first game on them
the most extreme bad case would be like melee fox and falco where it max disorients you and minimally disorients the other guy
Its more likely to disorient them tho
If you legitimately play the characters you should not get more disoriented than the other person
no what if you disorient yourself by switching if your chars are different enough
I usually dont switch because its hard to be confident but switching almost always feels correct when I do
If you play two characters of equal skill level and they have the same MU against a character should you basically always switch game 2 in a set
Her name kinda sounds like eulogy
She said we made her feel young lol
She deserves it
I hope so
If it circled back to her
I wonder if Eulji got her money back
Radio
Ratio
Meet noodle was SCREAMING it's significance at us
I actually cant believe Epcots anniversary was yesterday
Is the effect getting stronger

When do we start the second
You could call anything the first half of circling then
Thats basically what I said
But if you go back to a you're circling
If you're going from a to b you're not doing any circling
People also say it at the beginning of the loop though
Well you say you're circling back cause you're trying to complete the loop
The first half of circling back is really circling forward, but it also doesnt begin to be a circle until the second half
You joke now...

Michael getting kinky by dipping his whole self into raw chicken juices tonight

People need to understand   A low level player can do the same  as a top level player       .   What separates people is what happens after. Death
wow i was so confused
Incorrect words to omit

it's wrong because in the step where we removed 2 ppl from the group, clearly that can only work if your group is at least 3 people so n=2 but we only proved it for n=0
the only use of math
My TA is so foreign that idek why it's wrong and proving it wrong means that all people aren't gay so for the sake of argument I never learned it, it doesn't exist, and all people are gay
yea it's great
therefore in any group of people, all of them are gay and therefore all people are gay
We went over this in recitation!!
and in the n+1 case, just remove one person from the group and now you have a group of n people and we assume that any group of n people is all gay and just do that with removing someone else from the group to show all n+1 people are gay
so in a group of 0 people, all 0 are gay
and that given if a group of n people is all gay, then you need to prove a group of n+1 people are gay
so like you need to prove that for some integer of people, they're all gay
it's the same
do you know the proof that all horses are the same color or that all canadians are the same age or something
I wanna hear it
not to be like tmi but like i just masturbated and then thought of a logical proof that all people are gay by mathematical induction so i'd say my brain expanded
I gained the ability to control perception of time during no nut November
like i don't think i've ever heard of a person flicking their clit and then feeling existential dread and crying themself to sleep
It expands your brain in the same way moving a huge throbbing couch out of your living room gives it more space
considering the number of memes i see about feeling shitty after jerking your cock i think it's based on the genits of masturbator
do you think masturbation expands your brain

it sticks to itself but it doesn't stick to wet things
Its viscosity is so high
closing your mouth while brushing your teeth DansGame
How are you guys losing toothpaste all over the place
if you close your mouth it doesnt fall
by that you mean let half of it fall into the sink
Just spread it with your teeth
1st water is to rinse it off and 2nd water is to spread
I just do it to sterilize
wait people use hot water on their toothbrush
oh i only use cold water
whats the point of putting water on it twice
Is putting no water on your toothbrush at any point the same as eating dry cereal

wtf
wait people put water on it again after
then i run my tooth brush under it
i run my hot water until its steaming
water hot enough to kill germs would be hot enough to scald you
i feel like the water would barely do anything for that
The before is to get rid of the bathroom poop germs though

i used to do before and after but now the before scares me
Slight expansion
I can accept before and after
Water before and after
Yeah you push it into the brush unless the stream has the power of a firehose
i feel like it sticks better when you put it on dry and then when you do the water second, it pushes the paste deeper into the brush
water second is more likely to make it fall off
1. water the brush  2. apply toothpaste  3. flatten and spread the toothpaste with water
i'm overly scared if i put the water first then the toothpaste won't stick to the brush as well and then it'll fall off
wait that's what i do
this is almost as egregious as the hot water question
who puts water on their toothbrush after the toothpaste wtf

It could also end up tacking on a pretty small amount of time to the end of your life, but I guess if you devote your time to plugging USBs in correctly you could live a really long time
extending your lifespan is optimal I think because it could theoretically add another day
Would it be better to always plug USBs in correctly on the first try or extend your lifespan by the cumulative time you waste on trying to plug them in the wrong way

i don't know makio's personality but i would assume he and all might would resolve their differences peacefully

the most recent pinned message is the unofficial pinned message of the chat
idk what the pin means but i don't think i came up with that phrasing so if it's an award i don't deserve it

the question isn't "winning," but how much was lost
nah no matter which of the resolutions of weed we get (and all of the ones that are possible in america are deeply flawed), the war on drugs destroyed countless innocent lives and sex trafficking vampire billionaires got richer off of it
Its kind of inspirational that weed defeated DARE
Like on the grand scale it's way more obvious of course
It is interesting on the micro scale
Maybe all the dvd stores are weed now
An economic system
Its like an ecosystem
And now cannabis stores are here so theyre slightly lowering the concentration of other stores
Like as vhs and dvds came into existence they necessarily displaced stores you would otherwise have seen
Isnt it interesting how the rise and fall of industries influence the breakdown of stores you see
homosexual relationships must be so equitable and freeing
like as the woman you're expected to support your man and raise your kids but the man gets a life of his own and you can argue that it's not so bad in 2019 which is true but you're still raised that way your whole life and you get judged for not fitting into that
i hate how asymmetrical relationship dynamics are or more like gender norms in relationships i guess?
also i want data on poly relationships/open relationships
i'm sincerely curious what the marriage rates are in like 10 years
people in general nowadays are lonelier than ever before, and gender relations/dating discrepancies are really well described by contrapoints when she's like  "women get shittons of attention but a lot of it is bad and horrible/men are mostly invisible."
idk thao. that's how the narratives usually go but things are complicated
i feel like a lot of ppl do the first one and then the second one later in life right?
My thoughts exactly on megala
cuz i don't wanna bet either way and feel like i've made the wrong choice on my deathbed
i wish some form of reincarnation was real and included memories of past lives so i could try out different things
other times i'm like "i don't wanna miss out on the experience of having a human life partner"
sometimes i feel like i wanna be single all my life and only have sex in flings and just live with a dog
idk the more i think about it the more troubled i am
idk cause the idea that i need to get with some guy to not be alone when i'm old and pour so much of myself into one relationship for the rest of my life is so ugh
except instead of the government it's a rogue supercomputer
tho i should mention i've wanted to write a short story about this
My first thought from the notifications was that this was about if the computer prescribed you a personal twitch partner to watch
I'd trust my gut over the computer though so if I'm not feeling it with the prescribed partner I'm not going through with it
Maybe?
Honestly prob im lonely AF lol
If the government had a computer that selected your most compatible partner and issued you to each other would you accept
idk i guess like how people really put their self esteem on the line and rejection is like judging ppl binarily and also the way ppl pair off just seems kinda weird and like it can lead to isolation sometimes? idk really i just have a lot of vague feelings towards it that i haven't really verbalized
Wait what about the dynamics are you referring to
it just seems so artificial and really hurts people
relationship/romance dynamics are so bad
Our friend was like super okay with it for whatever reason lol
A girl i was good friends with confessed to me in highschool while i had a girlfriend and after we just sat with our other mutual friend in between us for like the last 3 months of senior year and never spoke to each other again
If only we could just reproduce through binary fission
Although when someone walks their confession back too far it makes for funny dialogue
I feel like you dont want to pressure the other person but if you go too far in the other direction its also problematic
we can still be friends
If you confess your feelings for someone, what degree of if not thats cool though is appropriate

The second final level
@Andy Bow @Rahul Ramasubramani my holiday party is at the zen museum this year

"Shes not like other abg, she plays smash"
Gaming
Literally fucking ANYTHING
Yaseen do you even Hobby
abgs have like nice software engineer jobs now
What hobbies does anyone get patted on the back for
"she [hobby]" is actually a hilarious phrase
Subtle Asian traits was the most basic group Ive ever seen
I think it would be nice if I could do hobbies and get patted on the back for it
yea it really caught on with the subtle asian groups
And every post is just an abg with their friend saying "don't worry she's not like those other abgs, she [hobby]"
I think abg is used a lot in subtle asian dating
https://youtu.be/qW1a3UOAIaw
This one only
Ive never heard anyone else say it
In what context do people even say abg
Im picturing more trophy wife than medschool
She's just like a dream girl at that point
An abg who is able to do that transcends abg status
Well alright that's not true but it wouldn't have been to the same extent
Before if u did Molly and went to a concert no one thought that was a personality trait
Life after 30
you hang up your false eyelashes and go to med school and then have a great latter part
I feel like it's something that could only exist w social media
wait what latter part
Then the latter part is 
Well the first part
you live an eventful life
That's a requirement
you're hot af
Thao what's a benefit
Ohhh im linking this to names now LOL
Cause before they were just really cool white girl esque asian girls but then once the term abg cropped up it sorta exposed how cut paste that sorta personality can be
they usually have dyed hair and there's a lot of blonde ones
I think they were until the term abg came through
they have super amazing makeup skills and go to raves and are considered slutty
This is some yellow fever shit
You know what
I feel like abg's aren't respected
Ah
Asian baby girl think those sorority 5'2 asian girls who drink boba and are generally impolite
I feel like it must be amazing
Whata abg?
Like i can't think of a single benefit of being an abg
omg i wish i was an abg and i love blonde abgs :(
Blonde abgs are terminal
I don't understand the abg lifestyle
it can accentuate hotness but it won't change non-hot to hot
what about blonde abgs tho
Being blonde increases your chance of that
1000000%
depends
What eye colors
Nah im talking hair tho not other things. Unless being blonde increases your chances of that
do you think a girl with 2 different eye colors would be absurdly hot
Having blue eyes might as well be having the sharingan
Facial depth, sharp features, gold looks valuable, blue eyes are objectively pretty
@omar
Speaking of hot tho, why are blondes considered hot?
Not worth the risk
LOL
like send my kid through the portal but like to a different geographic area so i don't have to see that
Yo that porn would be sooo viral
Make it happen
@pornhub
what if your kid returned but your age and hot like you'd be so uncomfortable
I have an idea for a fairy movie but I feel like the chance of it having already been done by 1 of the 7 tinker bell movies is somewhat high
Yes fuck the  timeline my kids living
Theres 7 movies in the tinker bell film series
So they come back immediately however much older
like how old
do i get to meet my kid but old
No way to return besides waiting
Would you send your dying child to get vaccinated in the past
Cause hospitals are using time travel
Yeah that's why i asked
Since the west is the future
Doesnt this essentially happen in real life all the time
Would you send your diseased 9 year old
yea so maybe like 10 lmao
Well a 6 year old isn't gonna know
Theres a weight limit tbh
there's a max age limit where it'd be up to the kid and not me
Toss me in
That would be a huge L
The future could be a destroyed inhabitable earth with the cure somewhere on it
Whats the max age limit before you wouldn't
Like if you were living in the dark ages but a portal to classical period opened up
what if it was your teen kid tho
like he basically didn't exist to me anyways and died of disease
i would 100% save my baby
What if the disease was only curable in the past
Toss me in too
Toss him in fuck it
His baby isnt even diseased


Id yeet that baby through the portal without a care in the world
Well all that's guaranteed is that they'll be able to live in the future
Either I don't have them bc they die a sad death or I don't have them but I know they'll be happy
If he were guaranteed a better life (i.e. Not on the streets) absolutely
Would you let them cure your baby
But he couldn't return to the past
If your baby was going to die from a disease, but the only way to cure him was to send him to the future where they created the cure
unless they cloned your body and pretended that was the twin
but they'd know there's another one out there
What if you're twin killed you and made it look like a suicide
@The Effect
My calories
Omg
Wait thao you just mentioned codenames?!!
whoever invented this gained weight making it
You can literally just play this with regular codenames
Who saw the need to make this

i need to measure this
guys how much calories does codenames burn

The wilhelm scream is male
idk if i've ever heard a guy scream actually
it starts at a young age
yea it would make sense
I thought that was the actual reason
sometimes i think like women screaming could be an evolutionary thing calling for help
Sofry accident

Guys are just rabbits
Yeah I lose the capacity to produce noise if anything
When something scary happens I freeze up and fall silent
Yeah Im not a screamer
i feel like some ppl are definitely inclined to make more noises and some are inclined to not make noises and the stimulus level doesn't matter


You sing during karaoke, you run when a clown chases you with a chainsaw
Like my reflex is to not be noticed I think
Idk I feel like when I get scared I freeze up
I feel like you just haven't had enough extreme stimulus to react to
A lot of people dont know that rabbits scream
Its pretty different as a conscious decision
Well i like to over react cause i think it's funny
And it seems other people are like that too, so I wonder what determines it
I feel like Ive almost never felt compelled to make a noise
That part probably isnt horror specific
Also, movies try to target them because they bring their boyfriends but guys are more willing to just go alone lol
I heard young women are like the main demographic for horror movies
imagine watching a horror movie with only your friends
imagine watching a horror movie with only guys
i scream when someone enters the bathroom
Its not about the level of fear
dont underestimate the level of fear induced
pro haunted houses are big scary
i feel like the screams are essential and guys don't do it as much/the same
going to a haunted house with the nsm bois sounds hilarious and super fun
who are you thinking of?
guys dont react as much??
The best you can hope for are some relevant memes
Because guys dont react as much
why do you think guys dont make haunted houses fun
any experience is objectively more enjoyable with more genders
what things arent improved by women
i need to hear more guys' screams in my life
honestly
gotta get that scream ready
Guys dont make haunted houses fun
what kinda nonsense is that allen
Or actually there just have to be some girls tbh
i guess we'll need a talking dog too
rip nyu smash haunted house trip :(
huh
Its important to go to a haunted house with a good gender balance
i haven't been to a haunted house since like school haunted houses
Perhaps that was the true terror in the end
which one did you go to
The last time I went to a haunted house I got a relationship
gotta pay dem actors
i guess manhattan haunted houses have to be that expensive tho
i'm down
around 40
How much is it
manhattan's scariest haunted house
anyone wanna go to blood manor
is that deceptive

LOL whats that???
Costume quest
cough cough halloween party cough
i wish i could play more of them
horror games are crazy
it hits a deep part of you that your brain was never meant to understand
the stimulus is overwhelming
its actually so scary cause you get so immersed
viewer agency + horror is too powerful
Damn thats both the future and the past
so you could hear it breathing in your ear
they also recorded good sounds
but holy shit in vr
cool even
when you see a picture of a t-rex its whatever
like, i was honestly sweating a lot in this vr dinosaur thing
So does reality
vr honestly makes things that arent usually scary scary
But in vr the scary thing could actually be behind you
that shit is too scary
With a screen its like you have no danger of not noticing things
you ever play a vr horror game?
its pretty kinetic already tbh
Vr has a lot of potential for horror
or any of those rides that have some story
or the spiderman ride
in universal
have you been on the harry potter ride
he's like watching a show
like scrooge is literally just taken along for a ride
its 3rd person at most, but youre constantly looking at the characters like a show
vr a christmas carol would be cool
are the telltale walking dead games 1st person, i can't remember
In theory could essentially just be along for the ride inside a movie
vr = viewer agency
But like, there doesnt necessarily need to be viewer agency
what first person game has the best story
i mean idk i barely understand vr
writing for vr sounds so hard
Yeah but its like an additional dimension of complexity
wait we talked about this
when you write for vr youre relinquishing a lot of narrative control to the viewer
I mean not much
Well
whats stopping you
I wanna write for it
Yo I hope vr stuff picks up
"ah dad you're still watching 2 dimensional shows?"
Also we can watch anime with our kids, and to them it could feel like our parents cartoons that we have no interest in
And consider the sheer magnitude of things you can get your children to believe
Makes you wonder what things your parents told you that youve yet to realize isnt true
And it was a long time before I questioned it
When I was a kid my mom told me rabbits dont know to stop eating so if you keep feeding them they just die
No one knows what happens when you collect a mushroom as Fire Mario but I assume he just passes
That is true I suppose all of them become satiated at some point
Well in theory it isnt more or less infinite than that of many other game characters, right, although its a larger component of his identity
If we are to believe that his stummy is infinite then he's complicated
I remember that yeah
I think he shows hunger in 64
I feel as though it's never a point of the games to mention his appetite or how hungry he is but he clearly revolves around eating
How hungry is Kirby?
If you killed your identical twin would it matter if you leave biological evidence
because people don't necessarily get exactly the same rhythm of hunger every day
why would you design it like that
like why is it such a thing
having an awkward amount of meal left is so common
I just ate from my leftovers
Did you overestimate your hunger or underestimate how filling the food would be
so it's hard for me to be like "that's too little for me to leave"
usually i'm down to err on the side of eating less

What are the leftovers
But if I save the rest it might not be enough standalone
And Im full and theres still leftovers
I was eating my leftovers
Why would you eat it now if you're not hungry
You drive a hard bargain
nah for me the bar for eat it tomorrow is like 65%
And its like you could eat it now or tomorrow
Do you guys ever have like 80% of a meal left
The second coming of overwatcy
that's on my must watch list
Overwatcy 2
friendly reminder that the chinese government made an anime about karl marx
If not does anyone want to be a founding member
Is there a movies chat
idk if it even has that much filler
like a lot of good eps
thinking about historical events it's a pretty godly anime
yea i guess that's true
But from the perspective of within a story, it should feel like there will be a bad ending
and then that ruins the anime
mainly i was thinking our anime would have a bad ending
I mean real life is basically the bar that all stories strive for and never reach, so I feel like its the best story by far
yea actually a lot of wars are anime
The existence of America
the kennedy assassination
like what was a historical plot twist
Probably
does our anime have plot twists
Yeah but those are usually good horror movies
that's our anime
like you know when you're watching a horror movie and you're like omg they're so dumb why would you do that, they're asking to die
Whats narratively wrong with our anime
we live in a cyberpunk dystopia minus the cyber and punk with added idiocracy
there's an alternate dimension where a good writer made our anime
Most are
it's a poorly written one :(
This is an anime
so there are people who have been confronted with the fact that jesus didn't agree with them and basically responded by believing in something new
there are some far right people who believe christianity was the start of "the west"'s descent into degeneracy
Yeah I guess if literal Jesus was running for President the election itself would be relatively unimportant
like if literal jesus condemned u that'd be crazy
there are far right people who believe in like... neo-paganism
but here's the thing
but we live in hell
i feel like if we're assuming jesus returned then ya, anything's possible
but what if literal jesus was like no
chapo trap house is so good at describing american culture and politics
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbnN_BOk99c
various christian/jewish/muslim teachings involve not hoarding wealth in ye olden times when the amount of wealth on the planet was a pimple.  the oligarchs currently own around 3 TRILLION dollars in assets and have convinced like 70-80% of americans that it's their god-given right to sit on it while people starve for no reason  americans, including and especially evangelicals, literally do not give a shit what jesus actually thought and did
What's it like now allen
Messiahs have it rough the first time around
Would assume that they're the second coming of a messiah
But a good amount of religions that already exist
They'd probably quickly get a cult following
If someone in the world appeared with super powers today
Jesus is unable to win purely cause he's not an american citizen tho

A kaijudas
If Jesus fought a kaiju would you believe it was him
Are they drift compatible
Next to batman
Add literal Jesus to the neural network
But Im sure literal Jesus could prove himself to his own believers at a minimum
People would understand eventually
i feel like christians would be the ones saying it's fake the most
Well maybe non Christians would say its fake
He'd just keep doing them then
Which is disappointing
ppl would be like that's fake
Thats like my entire relationship with Christianity
The idea and teachings of Christianity are mostly so good and people are so bad 
i feel like that still wouldn't convince ppl
He just has to do like 1 miracle
What?
He could do magic
there's no way he could convince ppl he's jesus
Damn this is making me depressed
I mean Id hope so
Im saying that the country has a ton of Bad People
Yeah but the return of Jesus would probably bolster their faith
I completely agree
He's just a great guy
Even separately from religion
Im saying that a lot of people that celebrate themselves as devout Christians are not saying so in good faith
That's big good
All he does is heal people and shit
He would be pretty popular
Id vote for him if I did or didnt know it was him
Listen
Wouldnt you vote for him
If you knew for a fact he was the biblical jesus
I dont think Jesus would be popular as a person today
I dont really think he would
And I think he would fundraise pretty easily
Complimentary fish and loaves provided
We can assume he would give pretty good speeches
Challenging authority and heresy basically
I meant like Jesus was a Brown, Socialist Jewish man who supported sex workers over bankers
Why did the romans want to kill him
Wait i forget
What does he know about foreign policy
Allen has a point actually
Do unto others
Love thy neighbor
Are his policies sound though
How is he not winning
Jesus can literally do magic
Exactly
I feel like it could go either way, but either way it went would be by a landslide
Which is unfortunate
Absolutely not
No
If Jesus ran for president would he win
Trump is 63

What's the best cinematic romance
The elasticity of romance is so high
And Sarah straight up said they only knew each other for a few hours but loved a lifetimes worth
Imagine being in love with someone from the past you only have a photo of
You're getting hit by that shit and you're both goin down
Cause it's not like you can shield in real life
Realistically not many people would be able to defend against someone crazy enough to drop kick
Hope she gets added to Ult in the next dlc pack
ryu and kens actual karate teacher who teaches them shotokan doesn't have a dp so he's not a shoto lmao
Corrin has a fireball and a dragon punch
Luigi has an actual fireball
like spiderman in mvc
yea a lot of ppl are shotos
Like Luigi
shotos are basically ppl with a fireball and dp now
in sf their karate style is called shotokan
What is a shoto
like why are they called that?
Why are ryu and Ken shotos
Actuallyx all of his moves are wait
ryu weak utilt in real life
Thats fine too
Or sex kick
Imagine if you could sex in real life
Imagine if you could sex kick in real life
The initial hitbox is fine but risky
Just dacus tbh
actually snake dash attack
Wolf dash attack doesnt seem like it would have a good outcome in real life
belmont dtilt
You could also just wolf dash attack
You can snake ftilt out of a run
Hi Allen!
Imo, just superman punch them. Its cooler and youndont almost die
@Barry Tessler
Ideally if you are drop kicking you have a hard read youre going to hit, cause if they block it you prob die
Its more powerful because you can safely put more power into it
i feel like the brand identity of drop kick is power and not safety tho
The advantage of drop kicking is if you approach with a different body part you basically need to enter their strike zone so you might get vantaged but if you drop kick correctly that couldnt happen
I wouldnt
Would anyone here not just shoulder tackle
That and you dont look as cool
Yeah but arm pistons are weaker than leg pistons I think
you'd go farther moving forwards and you can piston your arms and you wouldn't get a concussion
Thats why normal people tackle
So
How don
ok but what if u used ur arms instead
Theyre not really fg safe, theyre safe like you dont get a concussion from your attack
If you can tech it
which is probably possible
Yeah but you get good oki
unless you could tech your own drop kick
so i feel like it's not really plus
but also you hard knockdown yourself
Drop kicks arent that plus on hit
you get a hard knockdown
Cuz Im pretty sure you get a knockdown from a successful drop kick
Yeah but on hit youre SO plus
but is more minus on block
it does less recoil damage if you go feet first
+7
Safe on block
i guess it's safer tho
it's gotta have less reach cause you can't jump forward nearly as far if you make your legs go first
And you dont piston your head
https://youtu.be/DAzAc4ni5NM
But you dont hurt your feet on them
yea all of the force comes from u pistoning ur legs???
There's not thaaat much spinning
That would hurt
wouldn't all the force be wasted on you spinning
And you can piston your legs
Now imagine doing that to someone
With your feet
Imagine jumping but trying to land on a wall
Your legs have way more reach
Cause kicking is safer
like you'd be wasting energy spinning into a feet first position
ok but if you're jumping at them, why are you jumping at them feet first and how is that more powerful
Tackle with ya feet
But you can also just tackle which is the default choice
Kicking is safer than launching yourself headfirst
Its possible to dropkick in place
You don't have to run cause you're jumping towards them
You dont need to generate force in smash
But do people do it in real life
old one was cool tho like i have no idea what he was doing
it's so much better than old fsmash
or like that's not where the power is from
Bowser FSmash is just one of those things to be greatful for
bowser barely moves forward in his drop kick
yea like can u drop kick in place like ppl do in games
I have no idea
so shouldn't you be going at them like head first/feet last
like the force comes from your feet
how do you get the force to propel yourself
Bowser's fsmash
Youre basically just launching your full body at someone feet first
Does anyone drop kick in place
like how does it work irl
unless u do it from a run
how does a drop kick have power
Chad
Wait was that when he said he didnt notice
Like it might as well be a mad lib
Yo when he tanked a dropkick from that one kid in South Africa
If you think about it hes had like the most absurd life compared to normal people
During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest.[6] He went AWOL during basic training so he could take part in the competition and then spent a week in military prison: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences."
Schwarzenegger was nicknamed "the Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy" during his acting career, "The Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator") during his political career, and is commonly known in Japan as "Shuwa-chan" ().
i copy the image and it's almost that
My phone would be so happy
I wish iPhone had an option to save an image for 5 minutes
Okay so I looked it up and OoT is played on Japanese Virtual Console
If I read Chinese I could read the Sphinx text when I miss fish clip
What is it for OoT I think it's either Japanese or like Hindi lol
i bet if you switched to chinese you would beat armadas time
Chinese is fastest in odyssey early game
most games dont even have chinese
also on the same topic of language information density, i never understand why like french and japanese and italian or something are the fast languages in speedruns like shouldnt it be chinese cause there'd be less characters in the text box???
If you could say interestive, it would be better
Or like, attracting
Its as if you could call something hungering
The main problem is interesting
Like you can be interested in an interesting interest
Interest needs more variety in in word forms
Biblioteca is 5 syllables!!
We're in the school = 4  Estamos en la escuela = 8
With how conjugations work this makes a lot of sense
basically every language they looked at had the same information per time so the more information packed your syllables are in your language, the slower that language is spoken
also spanish is very fast but with low information density
english and mandarin have really high information per syllable but are spoken with less syllables per second and then japanese is like one of the fastest spoken languages but with low information per syllable
idk where else to put this but it's an really interesting article about language speed

Damn Reese took his shot
For this to work
That's the one thing you're gonna have to believe
I cant believe the future is in 10 years
Do you have the reading steiner
You could actually spend your entire lifespan dicking around in various times and then tell your younger self to get to work
Well everything you do affects the time stream
Since it might not matter
Would you procrastinate whatever youre supposed to solve
Imagine writing the bullshit excuse that a robot has to be naked
Onegai

Im watching the terminator
That might be the least disruptive option
This sounds like a job for the UGD
Like, you could also go to the time when theyre about to time travel
The authorities?
The twin towers?
Id go to them at middle school
Can i show the authorities footage
If someone on the street warned me about something saying they were a time traveler idk if I'd trust them immediately
How much power do you have
When do you go to
Okay lets just say 9/11 was a time travel attack
And set up radios at every place you go very important
And then time travel and just undo it
Theoretically you could wait till he's done with whatever he had to do
What if he prevented his birth
Would you be able to though
Like what are you trying to prevent him from doing
You could go back and kill him as a baby
Why
It highly depends right
If you had to time travel to stop an evil time traveler is the exact time hes interfering with the correct time to go to

i think
i remember when i played maplestory over 15 years ago i spent real life money on the metrosexual haircut
is that why u have to be a straight man to be metrosexual


The ultimate privilege
why is it a male-only class :(
So close
wtf why can't i be a metrosexual
Was just gonna say
Wait it says refined sense of taste though
My son evolved
This is Justin Ha
Goals

it's the next step in human evolution
Whats metro again
Metro is the class you can only pick in ng+
The master race
metro is all pros no cons
Let me be metro
oh yea makes sense
But I've heard of queer people whose lives were made so shitty by bigotry that they wish they were straight
Well I would
Probably
if you could pick your sexuality, would everyone pick the one they already have

The more chats you put me in the more things i have to forward allen

Human Wu's Father added Edward Cheung to the group.
Im saying this in the chad chat by the way
But anything involving ratings is super arbitrary anyway
Because to me its hard to say the experience wasnt a 10, but everything involved was on such a scale that there was clearly potential for more
Maybe its unnecessarily nonconforming but I think its intuitive to say Endgame is a 10/11 or so
I like messing with the denominator when thinking about evaluations
And this applies to western media too
I think about this a lot because stuff like Nichijou is essentially perfect within its own space, which makes it difficult to compare with shonen series
In some ways inherently less serious settings, regardless of whether theyre dramatic or comedic, have a much higher chance of executing flawlessly but on the other hand having any semblance of real stakes or dark elements is so good for driving audience interest that you can achieve relatively high success without being flawless
Like if you consider Dumbbells and Demon Slayer, the two defining creative works of the current epoch

I think so
Does forwarding an image use less data than saving and sending it
like not even close
so easily mana cost
mana comes back better than uh... losing an arm
Like mana versus alchemy basically
What's better, the mana cost and consumption system, or unlimited mana but using the law of equivalent exchange

i love that
that's awesome
She'd use spells that turn your party to zombies then start healing them (which damages them) but would occasionally use a spell that killed anyone who wasn't a zombie
FFX Yunalesca 
blam would you cast death on ally
imagine casting death on someone.  what a dick move. like if you cast magic missile or fireball you're giving them a chance to dodge. no, i cast death. you die now
So when they cast death on you and you instantly die you actually just faint
I remember looking up why Aerith can't be revived and it's bc the state of having no HP is just being knocked out
Oh okay :)
You can just revive her later
I think it self corrects to an extent where if its been long enough and there are enough people experiencing it for the first time there will be circles of primarily those people
Aerith *DIES*?!
I think that like, out of common courtesy you shouldnt talk about spoilers around a reboots time, but that you cant get mad if one happens
i'm talking about like, a kid born in 2005
well everyone in this chat is either super early zoomer or millenial
He's like an Adam Malcovich
But it's different since Zack is far less relevant to the public image of ff7
I learend about that from being aroundpeople who played it
I had no clue Zack dies at the end of crisis core
You know I think I was that kid at one point though
like i feel like it can go either way. if there's no reboot period on spoilers, then older gamers basically have a monopoly on the experience of aeris dying
Ff7 is so heavily associated w aerith's death I'd reckon no one can really get upset with any legitimacy. Sucks to be the kid though
Like, ive never played and i know that
well it could be a kid who's only heard of final fantasy 7 but isn't familiar with the franchise
Cause it can be assumed that if something is popular enough to get rebooted its popular enough for the average gamer to know spoilers
If you're hyped for a ff7 remake then you probably should know about Aerith's death like you'd know about chocobos or summons lol
Like theres no reboot perio
Id argue no..
so, it's generally agreed on that there's an "expiration date" on getting mad about spoilers. is it possible for it to become okay again to get mad about spoilers if a reboot/remake is coming out and it's been a while since the original was released?  like, i started thinking about this because of the ff7 remake. for a long time it was super OK to talk about Aeris/Aerith/w.e dying because it came out in 1997. But like now there are probably people interested in the remake who were born years after FF7 came out.  so like, if a zoomer gets upset about an Aeris dying joke, is there a point where it's reasonable for them to want spoilers to not be around?
Looks like someone's gonna be playing minecraft with andy
dang

Fortnite? Minecraft
Every game is just minecraft now
It never is
Life hasnt been the same since I witnessed Minecraft
There is no way this is real

We talked about the reptilian brain in the Nyu club belonging training
Like some deity definitely takes the wheel for the midsection
My auto correct spells the wrong word LOL sillhoette
It never works for me
Silhouette is a really weird case because I feel like you always have to yolo it but it always works out
i spell adderall wrong a lot and can't remember which letters have 2 and which letters have 1
I typod it while sending that message
I never have to think about fatiguing but I always spell intriguing wrong
Some words are just spelling demons
@Andy Bow
well he took some pills, chased it with some beer, and took a long drag of a cigarette.  i think he wants to die
Can you tell what hopper wants in this scene
Kick a puppy, softly
incognito bowser
Without speculating just like literally what it says
And write what that says about them
Oh more specifically she wants us to observe *how* someone does something
Observe someone opening incognito browser
Observe bowser holding shield
Go to a store that sells things you could primarily only use for one purpose
Or is it theoretical
Does it have to be something you can reliably observe in nyc
like hailing a cab was the best idea i could think of
And could be redundant
thats what im sayyinn
If you need to be certain based on the action most of the examples would be boring
looking at a dating app is good actually
our hw is to write real life observations of people's actions
yeah but you have to speculate
Reading/watching romance
If someone is lonely you can show them trying to dress nice, checking people out, having dating apps
gimme an example al
but like a lot of action requires some speculation to figure out the want
I think most examples are shown through actions

cause thats pretty obvious
i thought of hailing a cab
can you think of an example of seeing what a character wants only through their actions
Wrong chat
MMMM

people put it a bunch of different ways but this one is most succinct to me
story is just intention and obstacle
that looks right


That's one of the things it can technically do
wait did I pass
Yeah but imagine not knowing that
I think it can blow up your house
boomers
Wait WHAT
does it kill you instantly
idk what it does
Imagine seeing a creeper for the first time and having no idea what it did
I played Terraria a lot
Going into minecraft blind is a once in a lifetime experience
No that'll spoil it
maybe after I see it a few more times
Allen wanna play minecraft
I mean yes
But my friend took down our first server
I play creative mode every so often
are you still in it
The experience is so mystical and intimate
Minecraft was definitely the game i had the best first playthrough of
Wait that's actually really fun
Minecraft blind playthrough (no spoilers in chat)
Join the bandwagon
Minecraft got popular again
maybe it never began
We in it bois
The era never ended
I'll accept the responsibility
Or I guess I could have, but I didn't
I'm so sad that an era ended but I couldn't have appreciated its life while it lasted
the nintendo direct like a few months ago was the first time i ever saw fortnite gameplay but that's not nearly as bad as minecraft
maybe I saw it if they showed gameplay in a Nintendo direct
I've seen screenshots
like
I know
That's impossible if you've spent any time on the internet
I refuse to believe you've never seen minecraft gameplay before
it just feels weird, like I feel I should have seen this before, but I can't think of when I  would have
I opened a stream and someone was playing minecraft and it made me realize I've never seen anyone playing this game before
What do you mean first time
man I just saw Minecraft gameplay for the first time and I'm not sure how that could happen in 2019

Smart water is just watered up ganon
"Smart water: That's pretty smart. "
Their slogan was
I just got an ad for smart water
there aint nothing wrong with saying something is ghetto if its ghetto
arsene is watered down ganon
aren't u not supposed to say stuff is ghetto
oh but actually bootleg is also up there
but I would say ghetto tho
at least I wouldnt
No
or budget
discount arsene some might say
Kazooie is just watered down arsene
and I guess half of up tilt
Kazooie is literally all of banjo's moves besides jab fair and dash attack
I guess Kazooie literally carries
kazooie does most of the important moves, but banjo seems kind of important
1. literally invincible except when running  2. is gorl
kazooie
is banjo or kazooie better
there should be a dr. banjo who's the same except dr wing is stronger at the end
I'm jumping ship

yo it's gonna be extra bad when we're the meme generation because it's gonna sound like we're primordial entities

https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/story.php?title=american-slang-test
I'm tight
i guess tight evolved
Andy you need to take a slang test now
Ohhhhh
tight means mad
When you're in an unfavorable situation
You say i'm tight
Yeah it is
being tight isn't being in trouble
Being uptight and being in trouble are so different tho
"Uptight" rather
Gives me the same vibe as "stuck up"
I think "I'm tight" kinda makes sense
But the original meaning is for volume
It means that too
This is only reinforcing my lowkey narrative
U tite
whoa i thought lowkey meant like you kinda feel it but not really like what andy said
We're so tight
We're tight
Positively
How would you take that
"We're tight"
If someone texted you
I always see it like palu is lowkey top 5 which is somehow neither lowkey nor necessarily true
But when we're tight
I'm bad
*tight
But when i'm right
It's good?
Cause when something is tight
Does tight count
I always heard it in the form of almost a secret being told
I guess that's practically the same though
Isnt it supposed to mean like something that isnt commonly known
I thought it was for things that aren't immediately apparent
I hate Kelsey
Lowkey
Like
It's used to convey something you're feeling but not too loud
When is low key used incorrectly?
Tryna
Literally deadass
Like low key is almost always wrong and there must be some terms that are especially accurate
What slang is used correctly most often
chris do you mind if i ask what has you down? or is it just a general sadness
Fuck monkey
Fuck man
read the last chapter of purple haze feedback it works everytime for me
Someone comfort me but not actually but do
But crying is hard
I want to cry o
a large part of why its like deliberately shut down as even a conversation topic is that it gives a lot of fodder to "race realists" or like racial science in general
My problems are forgotten but not really
Im drunk too
thao it's not that bad we're pulling your leg
they talk about it in sapiens and its like very taboo (wrong word but more like not discussed) in the scientific community
wait sorry guys i got a little drunk and should not have asked that but also king is amazing
complicated
that theory is
tho i heard somewhere that homo sapiens who left africa and went to europe interbred with neanderthals
i tried him out today and i forgot that every game needs a wrestler
thank you for telling me to play King
also thao i know this isnt the chat for this but it basically is
no homo (habilis)
anything but the homo habilis
thao please
thao
the fuck
guys you wouldn't fuck a monkey but you'd fuck homo salients but would you fuck homo habilis
I heard about cuz of the haagendaaz flavor they had of Irish cream
ohhhh i actually never heard of irish coffee before
Jokes are banned
Damnit
O
Yeah that was a joke lol
andy that's what an irish coffee is
Now take off your stupid clothes
Holy shit
I love your poles
Andy I love your polls
I think ghetto versions look worse but by some technicalities are better
yeah but GHETTO is more important than at LEAST one of these
But people have preferences on which theyd rather say

these all of different connotations but budget and discount are virtually the same
I usually just say inferior
so sounds like suboptimal polling
These all mean the same thing
yeah and budget and discount are the same thing
@Doctor Vortex
Twitter only allows 4 options max
*your
Andy you're poll is missing the very important "ghetto"
but in the moment it's an act of respect
it still feels kind of significant, like when you screenshot something you'll definitely never see ever again

having established that these pins don't work
you know

Clearly knowing when you die is better than knowing how youll die since you can live carefree, but knowing when and how youll die is the real winner so that when your time comes, you can go out in the most unexpected way possible. Gonna die in a car accident? Go skydiving.

if u dissolve crack in coffee
If you combine alcohol with coffee...
But wait
And maybe alcohol
wtf is irish coffee
Coffee is like the second most culturally impacting food after bread
Excuse me?

aw. i'm needed

if i wanna see the bracket i type !bracket. i never consider how big the viewership is
idk i never thought about it before
for big streams someone else will consistently do it within a few seconds but for small ones sometimes you have to do it
what's the breakpoint in number of viewers on a tourney stream where you should type !bracket yourself
ye adultery laws are dumb but you can use adultery as like an argument in divorce court
Alright lets cancel adultery laws after we free weed
or jail someone for adultery
oh yea it'd be so weird to like legally enforce
It can matter for divorces without being illegal
It seems like its rare now even in places where its technically illegal
it's like good in divorce cases i guess??? idk
Do ppl actually get prosecuted for adultery
It seems like an antiquated thing to still be illegal
But I dont think its a Good Thing
It shouldnt be illegal yeah
Sorry was cleaning I meant like
Illegal socially things
I think thats one of those like
Yeah
Is adultery cheating on your spouse
Should adultery still be illegal
Thats fucking bananers
You guys ever think about how halo 3 had a form of Social media sharing in game

I didnt know that bail bondsmen are literally bounty hunters

what made you think of the phenomenon in the first place
so now im wondering
@Allen Wu the comments

Yes
is that movie good??? i want to see it

gabe knows all things
Gabe Rush knows how to play but I dont
No

Does anyone know how to play shogi
But glad we are on the same page

Allen
By who
suh lad*
also like in the middle of a salad discussion?
I was told I can't be here
why was I added to this chat
why was I added to this chat just to be informed burger studio is gone
Shaped the salad discourse for years
Exactly
Suh lads
Two
You saw that episode of sponge bob right?
By that definition a slice of tomato and some lettuce pieces work
get verbally obliterated
Potato or fruit
egg salad
What's more salad
Its a salad if its an arrangement of different fruits and vegetables all together
The Andy Bow Effect set the nickname for Sekai Murashige to Sapio Kai.
The Andy Bow Effect set the nickname for Samuel Hill to Doctor Vortex.
It just has to be a mix
Feels like the pile of sand argument
At what point is it a salad
and what does that mean for the definition of salads
So this is the product of true brain expansion
dude almost unironically i feel like if you peed on it after that, it'd be a salad but idk if that's true
like if I put a full ass tomato slice and 3 leaves of lettuce on top of each other thats not a salad
*can't
That's just vegetables
no you can just put ingredients next to each other and call it a salad
a constructed salad
Isnt a salad already deconstructed?
Wtf is a deconstructed salad?
The Andy Bow Effect added Allen Wu to the group.
oh I see similar questions have already been asked
is a lettuce wrapped ham sandwich a sandwich or just a deconstructed salad

Ask thoughtful questions
What is this
The Andy Bow Effect added Sekai Murashige and 4 others to the group.
Allen Wu left the group.
Burger studio is gone?
Plus every other meal
All day breakfast
Breakfast n go
wait what's the new place?
burger studio was wild cuz the burger never tasted the same twice
Sooo appropriate
Something about Uhall and fiending smash4 for years after it came out and well beyond its expiration date made burger studio so appropriate
At the cost of greasy deliciousness
It's probably healthier
The new place isn't bad tho

I just miss burger studio
I love that
Awwww
I like pronouncing bagels "bay-gies" but "baggies" might be the worst word ever
The Phillies
Chicken over rice    Chicken Overrice
A person at the fest talked about missing the phillies at burger studio like that was a term anyone said
I'm not a fan of calling them Phillies
Lobster roll
Philly cheese steak just removed any implication of a sandwich
Tuna salad sandwich
Hammy
Burger
Its crazy that the word sandwich was already dropped to begin with
And I don't think a four ingredient list has a nickname
It's at this point that they just let you intuit everything
Then we get to BLT
Then peanut butter and jelly is a lot less personal but rather intuitive
So a grilled cheese sandwich has one ingredient and it even goes as far as to tell you what's going on during preparation
Have y'all noticed how the more ingredients in a sandwich the less involved  the name becomes
I just had this thought right now
And they were right
Apparently it just costed more money to make both sides work and they decided it wouldn't be worth it
Where you do the reasonable thing but without giving a shit, then you do the unreasonable thing, then you combine everything you learned along the way
Or rather a conscious oversight
Did y'all know the USB not being reversible was a conscious design choice
I feel like a lot of things are probably tried in the same way as the USB thing
But it's mostly used in trials where there isn't a discernable difference in the execution
The usb theorem
First time to try, second time to calibrate, third time to perfect
All that third time's the charm implies about the first and second times is that they're not the charm
That's like the solution to a puzzle dungeon

the charm
I can't believe that was like the third time you made that joke today lol

I have a chance
Evolution isn't "Survival of the fittest" it's "Survival of what happens to survive"
I'm just memin
Not necessarily
Somewhere down the line being able to express your feelings became necessary for survival
yeah the rest of us is probably vestigial
Eyebrows are the most evolved body part
above us eyebrows still
no eyelashes below us
Imagine all the peep holes
it's easy if you try
imagine vertical eyelids
Horizontal eyelids are holding us back

There would be no prejudice in the world
Imagine if humans saw more vertically than horizontally

phew

Beauty never (and should never) last
People either love or hate save the cat
because isntead of being reality they just represent like everything that could have been
but one person dies young and they're pined after forever
Cause the ideals of the present are never guaranteed to be the ideals of the future
there are a lot of relationships that wouldn't go anywhere
Well it's relative
isn't that sad
Or live long enough to become the false reward
You either die the true reward
think about how many true rewards would be the false one if the story was longer
Having a false reward and a true reward is sooo good
the reward one is good because it's as vague as it can be without being clearly fraudulent
What a compelling title idea concept
it's called Save the Cat
I still like the reward one the best
he's the author of a popular screenwriting book
there's like a million different story breakdowns that are pretty similar but make up their own terms
Who is Blake snyder

Nah show me
have you seen Blake Snyder's beat sheet
idk if it's a spoiler or not so I won't go into it I guess
No spoil
So Pi tells the whole story about how he survived at sea with the tiger
And theres a good tiger
Stranded
A boy on a boat with animals
Well do you know what Life of Pi is about
A god?
Believe in what
But "kid is happy with new dog"
it was more of a generic willingness to believe rather than a specific religion
So not  "kid gets dog"
But how it affects the characters not like literally
or like steps I mean
Beats like every important thing that happens
That would be a good first lesson lol
beats like story components?
What religion did it almost make you
We went over story beats with this
I gotta watch it
Oh shooot really?
https://youtu.be/WjqiU5FgsYc

it almost made me religious
We talked about story beats today
I read life of pi
let me teach your class
You can replace filmmaking with literally anything
what direction are you supposed to read in
Wait this is the most hack NYU thing Ive seen in a while
+/or
but idk what this notation is
But she worked on life of pi so??
idk I feel like the underlying concepts are probably sound
My teacher is kinda a hack
Right??
I don't get it lol
Idk if this makes any sense tbh

The true reward
Teach me dawg
when I know more I'd like to teach creative writing in at least an informal capacity
This literature is Shmooving
I don't actually care that much lol but i was just mad at myself for not just writing fantasy
It's in tandon
It does feel good when i bring up a word and then everyone uses it tho
It's kinda infuriating when someone says an answer that's like the one you would've said but worded so much worse
what school is it in
It's nyu
wait is it part of school or like an independent thing
The teacher is asking such obvious questions and these kids, maybe cause they don't care, are giving such sloppy answers smh
It seems almost like a highschool english class tho
Relatively chill
20 students in a room
what kind of class is it
In my narrative class i didn't want to write a fantasy story just yet cause everyone was doing realistic stuff, then someone read their fantasy story and everyone loved it and it wasn't even that good ohmwygawd
I feel that at work too
Thats absolutely true
Gosh it's the worst when you wanna say something in class but you're not sure and then decide not to and someone else says it and gets praise from the class

The papers want to marketalize on their deaths quickly so they have the articles preemptively ready
But I also stopped watching after the 5th episode
They talk about that in Code Geass
Yeah Allen there've been times where a death hoax caused them to release those obituaries while the person was still alive.
Kinda weird
I found out some news orgs have prewritten stories about the deaths of famous people who haven't died yet
Like thats something I sincerely would not want to do but I may have to because my grandmas lived with us for the last 9-10 year
Ive been thinking a lot about (not that its a good thing to think about) possibly having to write my grandmas funeral speech
My mom was depressed after my aunt died so she made me and my siblings write our speeches for her funeral cause she wanted to hear what we would say
Imminent*
Intimate doom can be overwhelmingly sobering
To be able to say something like that in that situation is really admirable
Yeah so be honest with people, tell them how you feel, and whenever you leave someone tell them you love them

Its so sad that so many people suddenly had 30 seconds to goodbye to their loved ones and the majority of the victims didnt have a chance at all

The ethical silence is deafening

It won't be cold
What if they want it soon
Nah
Is it ethically sound to take someone elses soda out of the fridge if you put one in
Like physical bone, losing euphemistic bone was a separate symptom
This list of symptoms was like:  irregular periods, mood changes, decreasing fertility, loss of bone
Just found out about perimenopause... Damn that shit sucks
But bounced out of it when we started talking sour patch kids
From the talk about the concept of death yesterday I had an existential space out in the middle of work thinking about the concept of not being
Ra ra Rasputin Russias greatest love machine It was a shame how he carried on

https://youtu.be/SRWiqjgOyX0
Well, except parecki but thats not the point
I understand it, i dont necessarily agree, but i understand.  Nothing made by imperfect humans can be perfect
No system is perfect
Yeah it generally works and as I've grown older I start to understand why people dislike it
All systems have faults, we just decided this was the one that had faults we were ok with
For all the faults whatever system we're in has, we take that for granted
It's a privilege to not have to think about the next day and whether or not you'll be there
Yeah, like on one hand people.want to be successful and do great things. On the other hand, your chances of bad thinga happening is like a u shape where after a certain point it grows again
It hurts to think about
Ordinarily we worry so much about our ambitions and what we want to do, which is important, but in some ways its enough just to hope for a mediocre life where nothing terrible happens to people you care about
9/11 and things like the boat fire that just happened really put life in perspective for me

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/05/911-oral-history-flight-93-book-excerpt-228001
I found this except of interviews
I cant imagine what it must feel like for people who were more directly impacted by it
It feels strange to me how clearly I can remember 9/11 even though I was in California and in first grade

St Marks is the past
How odd
And that was me before, and it will be me
There are NYU students right now who are walking around the city for the first time, and people about to leave who are walking around for the last time
is it fomo
When I think about the passage of time I feel a sensation that isnt really sad but hard to compare to any other emotion
it's how to teach them how to deal with their own mortality that's hard af
well i think i could teach a kid how to deal with deaths of loved ones
If i get my kid a dog and it died I'd be shtumped
You can't even really console that
Dang yeah and like
one day when i was like 7 and on vacation i randomly realized i would die and i ran up to my dad and hugged him while crying
yeah but i've also felt like the worst shit when i was a kid
And i can't really remember any of it
I feel like we probably experienced the purest joy when we were smol
I mean it also demands the question of what defines "memory." like the body experiences changes when you feel happiness, it's not just some ephemeral thing. does your body experience the benefits of having been happy for those hours you saw this hypothetical best movie?
it'll make me want to do it again to remember
I feel like its worth it to do things you like even if you wont remember, because even in regular life your memories of things fade anyway
i mean honestly that'd probably be ok like obviously worse than not getting date raped at all
Obviously that could affect your body after but I feel the after effect isnt the main issue
I mean then what if you get date raped
i feel like if you don't remember it it basically didn't happen
It was like, if you were going to be subjected to horrible torture, but you wont remember it and theres no effect on your body / etc after, would you be okay with it
I think the idea is interesting, and I just remembered we talked about basically the reverse of the premise in a philosophy class I took
Would I remember that I enjoyed it
No. I value my time and money off memories
Like would you pay to watch a movie that would be the best youll ever see, but you wont remember it
Would it be worth it to pay money for an experience that you would enjoy a lot if you were guaranteed to retain no memory of it
They both have to do with faith I believe
Wack tho
Yeah for sure
There's words like heretic and heathen to cover this issue though
You have to use another word unless you used to pork jesus
Yeah it's pretty dumb lmao
How would you describe a state of being an infidel
Yeah but shouldn't one be the person/concept of the other
And both have to do with faith/trust
The latin word fidel fidelis means faith
Why does the word infidel have to do with a lack of faith/belief in God but infidelity is about a lack of loyalty in a sexual relationship
The werehog is only half the gameplay, not the game
And no other sonic game could come close to unleashes presentation. Everything has so much personality, charm, and small little efforts added here and there that come together really well
Excuse, sonic adventure 1 is adorable and important. It was the only good get to the end 3D platformer at the time
like if sonic 06 had a decent developer process and wasn't constantly shafted to get it out there for the anniversary, it'd be one of the better sonic games
yeah it's fucked. it's super buggy and just in general clearly unfinished, but if i'm being honest, there are more poorly conceived sonic games out there. Sonic Adventure 1 was a mess, Sonic Unleashed is half of a good video game and half rubbery slop molasses that you have to wade through to get to it, etc.
Its pretty bad lol
so people have a worse impression of it than games that might be worse and even less playable
the honest truth is, and this is a hotter take: i've played much worse games than sonic 06. it's just that sonic is a AAA ip
To this day I think the Game Grumps playthrough of it is one of the best let's plays on the channel, possibly on youtube
It wouldn't be talked about if it weren't still THAT bad
Nah that's a fine take
Everyone should play it or watch a Let's Play of it
Sonic 06 sucks as a game, but it's an amazing experience
i'm gonna give a super hot take
Then he said "unfortunately this is Sonic 06, where the only thing that was properly executed was Sonic Team's reputation"
The reviewer was discussing the additional playable characters and how the approach to integrating them in the levels could have been amazing if properly executed
The most clever thing I've heard in a YouTube video recently was from a review of Sonic 06
And those things are what need to be prioritized
Because aside from all the things we want to and hope to do, there are some things that feel unacceptable if you died or someone else died before you could do those things
And I guess I could, which feels relieving to me
But that said, I tried to think hard about whether or not I could accept it if I just got hit by a bus today or if someone close to me did
Like, I thought I was able to think about it, but really there are a lot of concepts you only hold a fake comprehension of until it happens to you or threatens to happen
I find it literally hard to think about mortality
Realistically that isnt enough to just motivate us to do all the things we should be doing and keeping in touch with everyone we should but there should probably be some type of positive takeaway in there somewhere
The world is so interconnected now which makes it harder for any amount of time to pass without something bad happening within your sphere
And a relatively positive response to loss
Its kind of defiant in a way
I think its touching that this woman spent like three sentences saying that her daughters would definitely have been able to swim to shore
Interacting with the more individual and personal sides of these things is important for remaining human
And on a larger scale, tragic losses of life have a similar problem where its almost weird to highlight any singular event or even trend
So all you can really do is just endure it
Sometimes I feel so crushed when the MTA betrays me because when that happens its at the worst intersection of disrupting your life and being such a routine occurrence that theres really no reason to even bring it up to anyone else
The uncertainty must be unbearable when you have to rush somewhere and all you can do is hope your family is okay

The season finale twist
Yeah i don't think it can read emojis
Wait the search isnt working lol
No cause now the current pinned message will come up first
Should I fix it
I shouldve pinned them in the right order

You're a genius

Oh wait if you reply to a message with a pin then you can see all the pinned messages by searching it
New pinned message
Misery serves as a basis for both
But our ability to compare the feelings is pretty dubious
Im curious because the concepts of funniness and sadness are so often invoked in comparative contexts
How do we measure these things
Would one be funnier if it made you laugh longer, or harder
And if two things both made you laugh
If a movie makes you cry, was it sadder to you than one that doesnt
Does funniness require a face
If one joke makes you laugh, and another doesnt, was the first one funnier to you
What does it mean for one thing to be funnier than another
So with humor as well as other reactions / emotions
Elaborate
Is funniness linear
Its this



Bonus points if there's no faces either
What's the funniest picture with no text
Maybe they're adding frisk 
Like zero

Damn we really putting side characters in smash before the main character
This does put a smile on my face


Youre ugly, youre disgusting, I hate you, give me 200 dollars
Its the most clever thing i've ever seen
I love bo burham and that show in particular
There's no real gist
He does a lot of different stuff
It's a really good special i recommend it
I'm not huge on Bo Burnham as a whole
What's the gist
I have not
Have you seen this do you think it's funny?

I liked Sans a lot because he was a conscious character that didn't just spout 4th wall references
*each other
The writing was good cause they felt like they really lived in the world and interacted with each user
Like they were just playing off each other's character roles
Or like what was a witty moment
Who was the wittiest
I had similar reservations but it seemed witty to me
I could see that
I guess it's so tainted by tumblr for me that the quirkiness just came off as a bit annoying
I felt as though most enemies were straightforward and the trickier ones didn't require any more trial and error than tricky enemies of other JRPGs but I could see that issue really ruining things
but damn if the writing and music and environment didn't make me smile
basically the pacifist gameplay felt like ultra-watered-down SMT demon talks
i usually knew how to pacify enemies on the first try but that's because i'm Online As Fuck
But the characters and music and environment are so much better than they have any right to be for being done by one person
I just thought it was kinda annoying
And when i finally figured it out or looked it up i wasn't satisfied or enjoying it
Like a lot of enemies had specific sequences of options you had to select to pacify them
I mean they all have like 4 options
The game didn't charm me enough to enjoy it 
Undertale has a lot of enemies you literally can't defeat unless you get some inside joke
But i hear deltarune fixed that
I killed some shit early on and beat the game and got some super mid ending but the ending sequence was really good
my only beef with the game is that i felt like the gameplay was repetitive and kinda unexplored
that being said, the chunk i played was so fucking good and charming
True endings are wack to me
But not True Pacifist
one day i'll get back to it
I beat a pacifist route
but i still have no idea how any of the routes ended
I found out there was a secret ending and left it alone
i know a lot of the jokes because i'm Online
Its ok me neither
There it is
i never finished undertale
I know you havent played
i have a confession to make
guys
When I played it was an indie game that like 4 people at the Game Center knew about
It's def at it's best when you're 100% blind to everything
Got some good feedback
So while I was interning I asked if I could give one to the dev team about comedy games
At work at my old job we gave talks about like whatever topic were interested in if a meeting was to go too short
Not about games I find funny but comedy games
gta roleplaying streamers can be funny sometimes, but the game itself is fucking boring
I did a talk about this once
Trying to think of other games I find funny
Gosh undertale was wayyy overhyped for me
dude that scene put "Eat squid ink pasta" on my bucket list
Ive never laughed at a gta game in my life
i still never played undertale or deltarune tho so i can't compare
i played ttyd with my sister a few years ago and still thought it was amazing and funny
Yes I was quoting the line
did you see it
no really
MAMMA MIA
did you see the spaghetti yet?
I remember nothing from ttyd besides reading the diary and exploding
Im watching battle tendency finally and its up there with the funnier shows Ive seen
like damn
Paper Mario TTYD is unfairly hilarious
I think the humor would hold up
My guy 
it's all about paper mario ttyd
Undertake was actually really funny and charming
Uh i haven't played Portals in a while thao
I think I liked the dialogue of undertale way more than any other game
I think parts of borderlands funny
Its harder to make a funny game with words than without
Portal is still funny to me
i've played none of these games
https://youtu.be/5dNxiFQVlJg
what about the portal games
castle crashers or battleblock? i played battleblock a couple years ago
do you think it'd be funny if you played it now
Wait Allen...no...
The hand simulator is hilarious
The portal games are also funny
Funniest game i've ever played is probably Battleblock Theater by the same team that made Castle Crashers ironically
But i don't think it's funny tho
Making a game funny without using words is great
I think it's fantastic
like yeah castle crashers makes jokes without writing but that's not inherently a good thing
By writing i mean like spoken words
not lacking*
there are way too many games lacking writing
Ok that's even harder
That has no actual writing
hmmmm
What's the funniest game you've ever played
It's mostly toilet humor from newgrounds circa 2007
It's just goofy
Yeah, it's not high brow
Grow out implies that it isn't high brow
on her tail
there are some good gags, like medusa having a single Ugg Boot
Do you not like the comedy or do you just not get it
but real talk i did grow out of the castle crashers humor
are you telling me the eternally shitting deer isn't the epitome of comedy?
Is love a meter


Schroedinger's love
Is love quantum
My b
But then they say some flaggy things and you're just so conflicted
Dang it's crazy how you can like someone so much

Damn I thought you werent funny but

Am I a joke to you

Turns out
Damg i thought you were funny lol
Its not a gameplay issue for me
I dont think the humor of castle crashers is good
Why would you like river city girls then
I dont like it
Hot take
That game
So play castle crashers
Local co op only 
Castle crashers coincidentally is also coming out
Unclear if it has online co op barold
Wait did i not have a nickname
The effect of Andy Bow
Uh
My nickname
What was
Wait i forgot what it was
Are you getting it for switch? I can pick it up too if you want
I wanna get this game but I feel like its only good w friends
It That Gets Left Hanging set the nickname for Andy Bow to The Andy Bow Effect.
The scott pilgrim game is pretty good

That's the effect
Ohhh so your list just happened to align with the game coming out
Can I be on your list
It was on my list
I just talked about river city ransom today and then I saw the river city girls thing a few hours later
Oh what made you watch Scott pilgrim?
?
That doesn't count
Well the game is coming out
I was talking about river city ransom
Wait what does that have to do with the effect
Now time to execute 
I love this game so much conceptually
The effect
https://twitter.com/wayforward/status/1169656469123411968?s=21
like just he is ok but he/him is like making it clear
cause if you just say he, some ppl say he/they
i personally feel like saying he/him is confirmation that you only go by that set
i don't think so
What about she/his/themself? Do mixes like that exist?
yea but also there could be he/they or she/they
Oh wait is it because for less common pronouns you might not know the other words
He/him/his
Set
What do you mean by art
When people say their pronouns, is it always a set because there could be mixed sets or just so its obvious that theyre talking about pronouns
The jumanji lore
But nobody remembers the second one, so the actors apparently called the upcoming one Jumanji 3 even though its actually 4
I thought it was, but its actually in the same continuity as the first 2
Did you guys know the recent jumanji wasnt a reboot
imagine playing bad games when you're not looped up on dumb bastard juice
Theres an upcoming game for the jumanji movie
Yeah i can believe that. who'd want to play that sober
they have it at barcade i think
There's a Street Fighter The Movie The Game
Because that would be the game of the movie of the comic book of the game
The motion picture
Moveie
Game
Movie
Why didnt anyone bring that up when I was asking about like the LEGO move game
Yeah they made a Scott Pilgrim The Video Game that was a beat-em-up in the vein of River City Ransom
Thao can corroborate
I read that the comic was heavily influenced by River City Ransom, which I coincidentally played like two weeks ago
Yeah I saw chunks of the movie and heard the graphic novel was better
She had a girl fight
She's just like *is pretty*
she does like nothing in the movie
Ramona is much more likable and fleshed out in the novels

Also crazy how much younger Chris Evans looked
I didnt know anything about it so it caught me off guard when the crazy stuff started, but I saw it was tagged for martial arts and supernatural so I was slightly mentally prepared
I just watched it last week
I wanna read Scott Pilgrim at some point
And in Scott Pilgrim he was about to break up with Knives and she invited him to her birthday and idk if he went but it also stopped him from breaking up
Like in Legally Blonde the guy could have just broken up with her but they went to a special meal for it
i can't think of a time where it happened in a movie
Although doesnt this happen in movies, and the person always does the thing first, and its always a bad idea
But unless there were crazy circumstances Id probably watch
I suppose its easier to say that when youre not in the position where you need to break up
yea i'd watch the movie first lmao
Id probably watch It
My sister said she needs to break up and idk if I should tell her to watch the movie first or not
Lol
Wait it isnt a joke
Totally unrelated now but if you were about to break up with someone would you do it before or after your plans to watch It Part 2
mean*
i see what you eman
ah
Like in a one escape pod situation
Not totally related but I think one of the most poignant instances of love is when someone can allow their partner to be the noble one or at least accept it
that being said i love him
Whats love to ally
Because Ally abandoned all scruples and refuses to leave the moral shumps
Whos the antagonist of NYU and why is it ally
this person has no refinement
when in doubt, pinky out

Probably The Fool because he's a dumb idiot and also the protagonist of NYU
I wonder what arcana Paul represents
I wonder what level my Paul social link is at
Oof
we screw*
if i insert enough gifts into a lady's pie hole and level up my social link to rank 10 by answering the correct multiple choice questions, the universe will literally contort itself so you screw
But i think that returns to what love is for each person
Yo i feel the what if i have no idea what love feels like thing

Can your heart be color blind
So sometimes I think, what if I have no idea what love feels like, or maybe I did and never realized
Where we both see a thing as red but theres no way to know if were seeing the same color
Its pretty similar to the whole color thing
This is why its better to be game people so we can just get to the required number of support points
Im shook
Omg that means there can and probably often is unrequited love where both people have the same feeling
Yeah so someone might appear to fall in love easily if they just have a low bar for what is called love, or it could go the other way
Wait actually tho thats so interesting.  Cause its the same feeling but ine calls it loving everyone another calls it being nice
I always wondered because like, you could have two people who have the same feelings toward everyone, but one of them has a higher standard for what love is, it creates a large perceived difference
Its all really ambiguous because everyone basically only has their own conception of it
Love is weird as different cultures see it differently. For example, i have a friend who was raised to believethere is no platonic love... id say the second tho, but love can be learned
Does love work like if your opinion of someone is adequate enough in certain areas then you love them, or is it just a thing that either exists or doesnt exist
It's actually recommended that you eat pizza on a citibike
Idk about pizza on citibike
But you gotta pay a fee to access it just like the bus
Public
They actually confirmed that in star trek they're killing people
What about citibike
I think public just means that it's available for anyone out in the open to use it
In my philosophy class we talked about it a teleporter dissembles and reassembles you are you still the same person
Nah fruit snacks got those chemicals
so is public transportation stuff that has a schedule
Not pizza
Fruit snacks might be fine
If you don't request it it won't pick you up
Uberpool is def not public
You definitely can't eat fruit snacks in the teleporter
So maybe uberpool should qualify
I guess not really because if there was a teleporter that anyone could take to anywhere, it would still be public transportation
is the definition preset destinations then
Yeah but the lack of preset destinations makes it more like its transportation for you specifically
uberpool is available to the public and you ride with other people
I thought the point was that its transportation for the public
is uberpool public transportation
wait idk i feel like i personally defined it as being publically owned
I mean yeah public refers to its accessibility not its ownership
Yeah sure
Are we in agreement that public transport can be privately owned
But that was the best cup ramen i've ever had
I think the weirdness is more from eating pizza on the plane
And idk if it was the altitude or the environment or my emotions or everything
Although on my tokyo flight they gave me cup ramen
Idk I'd feel weird
Why not
I wouldn't be eating a pizza while everyone was sleeping
Aside from the designated meal times
Youre allowed to eat more on planes
I feel like the ideals of what you're allowed to eat on them are still similar
wait that's crazy
But theyre still public transportation
Arent subways privately owned in japan
they're private
Planes are public transport right
Where does a burrito fall
If you eat fruit snacks would you also eat pretzels or chips
Whutta distribution

Anyone could do it in brawl
YOUR BRAIN
Can you do that with the grenade too?
Their brain is beyond comprehension

That's already a story
YO
Idk if it was the same one
I saw a mouse in the morning on the sidewalk and this morning I saw a mouse on the sidewalk but it wasnt alive
What's the most interesting thing you saw today?
Then she told us to write 100 words about that thing about why we thought it was interesting or even make up a story about it
She told us to write that down
What's the most interesting thing you saw today
This teacher helps write some pretty trippy movies
I hope we get renewed
But then i wondered why i knew anything at all
And it surprised me how little people know about scripts and film and stuff
I'm talking a narrative cinema class with this teacher and a bunch of kids who only chose it cause it sounded easy

While skiing on the iss
All the food on earth is gone and you slip and die on a banana peel
I would think any ski accident on the ISS would have to be both those things
Yeah I'm dying in a tragic but hilarious skiing accident
rip chris
are they gonna kill one of us off
Hope we get renewed
This feels like the chat season finale
I brought the radio
I'll call the elevator
Been here
Andy let's go to the ISS?
This poll is no longer available.
and also the view of the entire planet i guess
zero g toothpaste
yeah but i wanna show my girlfriend toothpaste floating in midair

For you
in what sense tho?
we have space at home
like in history
Yeah the iss is probably the most romantic place to take someone

wait just to be clear ISS = International Space Station right?
This poll is no longer available.

Thou is romantic
This poll is no longer available.
Wendys or the ISS
Which is more romantic
But thousands sounds super romantic
Hundreds doesnt have and thou in it
So thousands sounds more romantic, but if someone actually gave you a hundred of something meaningful
But like, someone could actually realistically do something in the hundreds
Thousands
Thousands or hundreds
What number is more romantic
And the Nobel Prize for Literature goes to

A story about 2 European farmers
grain is grain
spain is spain
in my mind spain is full of that guy who was bad in the lizzie mcguire movie
That every other country looks dark in comparison
Europe is so overwhelmingly full of the whitest people imaginable
Do you associate Spain with white people?
ppl in america associate spanish with being a language of like marginalized/poor ppl but in europe, do they associate spanish with like white ppl from spain or something
Cheek to hemisphere
Crack open my skull and fart in my brain allen
The explosion is a waft

Solary | Glutonny
santa rosa brawl
Tallisbrawl
Dang what a word
Talll tall tall tallltaaal
I think 6ft is tall no matter what
Well is tall relative?
Or they are and you are
like some ppl just look tall
nah you think someone else is tall but they're not
Who thinks they're tall that's not actually tall?

I still have no idea what you're trying to say
also some ppl are the reverse like ppl think my brother is really short and then they walk up to him and it's like wait he's not short
yea i think that's happened to me with tall kids before where i'm like wait a minute they're actually shorter than me once i get up close
Also, dogs dont try to jump over fences even after they grow up so for people if at any point youre shorter than someone you might not try ever be able to see yourself as taller
Like in character
And some people are just tall in stature
You can also be taller than tall kids
Im not really tall enough for this to happen with guys but it can definitely happen in a homogender context
Especially girls
Sometimes I see people who look tall but are shorter than me
only @Justin Jones can know
wouldn't you think they're not tall
Isnt it crazy that tall people who are shorter than you think youre taller than you think they are tall
i watch the youtube ads that are like games
I've seen a million different.ads for it on YouTube but they're all basically the same. I was interested after the first, but when I saw a second ad that was the exact same but Ctrl f replaced names I was like "ok not happening"
The most powerful ad Ive ever seen
I got a YouTube ad for it and I watched all 2 minutes of it
Has anyone heard of Hooked

I think I have the video of my regretful bite
Of the egge
I wonder if we still have the video
It was a bitter burger

And I decided I would go in if it happened
Meanwhile Nick was streaming Ally vs Josh on WiFi and if Josh lost 10 games in a row he had to break an egg over his head
But when I got there I hesitated because I had just eaten a meal
But my mom cooked dinner so I ate that and then I went to in n out right after so I could fit it in still
But when I was in Cali for Christmas I wanted to go to in n out one more time while I had the chance
Hmm i guess so. Theyre like family owned or something right
In n out was also on the not actually a franchise list
in n out isn't a franchise i think???
What was that
The most shameful meal Ive had was at in n out
In n out would survive the apocalypse I hope
They use local and fresh ingredients
In n out would probably survive
Theres varying degrees of dependency right
What about other franchises
Unless theres some indication that they use local ingredients
I dont think so cause it seems to me that their ingredients all come from ronalds corporate bootyhole
Nah they would just close down.first and foremost
Okay but if McDonalds Corp. died the individual ones could become generic burger places right
Them mcnuggets from new york are the same in buttuck ohio  They are all sourced from the same black hole i believe
He wont make it anywhere close but still
I still can't believe Howard Schultz is running for President
Damn Daniel
Just googled it and this article says Starbucks isnt a franchise
I don't think that's feasible with a large scale business
Whats the word for when the HQ just owns and runs everything
Like I don't think you transform a restaurant that already exists into a McDonald's
I think the way it works is McDonald's HQ gives the franchisee the stuff they need to open a McDonald's

Is that what franchising means
Like if McDonalds approves
A random restaurant can just become a McDonalds, right
I find it hard to imagine that the top of McDonald's would collapse before any franchises needed to close
i'm pretty sure they'd die
Not sure
I mean I dont know how to explain it because I dont understand it, but if McDonalds went out of business would individual McDonalds die or just become independent
Some people would say the different staff between franchises is enough
Like how different does an establishment need to be to count as a unique restaurant
Depends on what you think distinctifies a restaurant from another
Okay so alike beneath the surface of every McDonalds, is there a unique individual restaurant
i understand it a little cause my dad wanted to get into it and buy some franchises
Barrys in the UK, maybe Barrys in Paris
HQ is thinking of expanding overseas
Yes. I'm actually a franchise myself. All over the country there are Barrys
Does anyone understand franchising
Mainly about finding meaning purpose and community
Theres a good chapter in sapiens about like the formation of religions and their original intention
Wholeheartedly agree
At the risk of sounding self-righteous,   I did have a phase back in 2013-2015 where I questioned religion more often on account of reading a lot of r/atheism and related videos.   At this point what I've realized is that while they do have a lot of sound arguments, I'd argue they're missing the point. I think it's a shame that religion sort of defaults to this basis for shame and judgement for a lot of people because it can be so much more
My parents didnt care so I grew up with pretty minimal exposure
Fuck Scientology tho
I had a bad experience with religion as a kid but I can't deny that it's impossible to replace

I like religion
Religion is also important because it's a major part of local communities
And if you took away religion then a lot of people wouldnt have anything to believe in
People can be strong, but for some people that strength is accessed by believing in something
It's a whole thing, I think it's one of the best things on an individual level but as it grows larger you see people take advantage of it
There have been so many terrible things that have been done for the sake of or in the name of religion, but I think a lot of those things werent done because of religion
Idk what the temperature of this take is but I have a lot of gratitude for religion
That is the point but you'll never hear that said outright haha
My dad tells me all the time that my life has been too...early? To really reap the rewards of faith
I suppose that idealistically, thats kind of the point
It's just more common
I think it's a form of confidence and happiness unlike any other
It makes me wonder if I would have been better off believing
I feel like in situations like this is when believing in some afterlife mechanism is most comforting, because regarding the people who died all you can really do is hope that karmic balance will somehow be restored
What happened with the California boat fire seems like one of the most horrific ways to die
For context i brought up a video that happened to have the back to the future sneakers in it and i asked sam about it
Oof cooourse the movie is back to the future

Holy shit

Like our states can just be used as countries in comedy
Its so weird that this can be done with America and itd be the same size/have the same comedic value
Where do I begin with this
so much to unpack here

or anything that doesn't exist is extremely well hidden
and a bunch of other lackings
people hide having no money
How can you hide what doesn't exist
melee is high skill and like all extremely safe moves into kill confirms
I miss Brawl because it hid my lack of combos
Experience being matchup knowledge and memorization
skill is dexterity
Actually it's 2019 now
Skill is made up of mechanics, game sense, and experience
but even that isn't necessarily true
usually heavy characters require less skill although you could argue it takes more skill to win with a worse character
i feel like it's different in smash like in brawl where no hits confirm into anything but you can still play safe and get the kill
I'd argue that winning with the heavier characters requires more skill tho
so I guess overall having safe options enables more skillful gameplay? Because otherwise you have no choice but to play bad or do nothing
When climbing its not the mountain that kills you, it's the pebble in your shoe
and in smash gameplay is more degenerate when your only options are unsafe kill moves, even though it looks bad when someone can fish for a safe kill confirm
they have really small hitboxes i guess
Assuming we're not counting stuns
I thought about this in Marvel because lights are inherently easier to hit but they also lead to more damage so you're explicitly supposed to be using them over strong heavies
There's a lot of practice and effort involved in getting them consistently
Kill confirms aren't necessarily "free kills"
But overall I'd say yes
It's highly situational
does weaker hits confirming into stronger hits foster more skillful gameplay

We swap

Now I'm here
this is the worst thing I've seen since yesterday now that I thought this through

reading these made me stupider
https://www.reddit.com/r/uselessnobody/top/
It's kinda scary
the phenomenon created an entire game in a day
Hoooly shiiiit
https://twitter.com/boomerangfu/status/1167596916860809217?s=20
I have never seen that logo in all my time at gamestop
Your fuckin mandela effecting me you sunnavabitch
No way
The first game is Skylanders: Spyros Adventure
They have no real relation
And they have the same characters
Even if the same company made them
That's like saying smash is a spinoff pokemon game
Spyro isn't from skyland or anything
That's wrong

They just added him in
It's not
I didnt know skylanders is a Spyro spin-off
Is that why people like that Batman Joker combo character
His ideology toward murder also allows him to be such a perfect hero to contrast the Joker
Batman's whole premise is that murder is not the path toward peace. To kill the villians he fights is to rely on death rather than wit and justice. It's a flaw but IMO it gives the character a lot more depth since he's motivated by something so intrinsically flawed
I might have triggered a curse
Actually I had a bunch of bad dreams too
Theres a plague in my office
It not though
"not a bank"


Let's go darkblues

Batman
Something something
like he doesn't "kill" but he beats random thugs to a pulp? and lets literal mass-killing supervillains live?
i mean that's like a super common question/criticism of the batman character
How's batman gonna not accidentally kill with those things
They're like throwing knives or shuriken if anything
Batarangs aren't even boomerangs
And it's sarcastic
The phenomenon is self aware
I have literally never seen a tweet related to boomerangs and even more specifically battle boomerangs before in my life
More like Boomeranghof phenomenon amirite
Fuckin
Ahhhh shit


that might have been a cringe joke but i'm smiling so idc
almost as much as Gamer-Americans
Innie-Americans have faced persecution at all levels of society
imagine?
i guess i meant on a societal basis
you right
imagine?
outies in the back of the bus
imagine belly button discrimination
Fuck outies
yea still
not an outie
wait, what if you have an innie button
your umbilical cord just shrives and dies and naturally becomes that
i can't believe this
i googled it and belly buttons aren't actually snipped and tied umbilical cords
thao we need you to be the authority on this, none of us know shit about biology
wait the answer is zygote
who came first, man or the zygote
Who was the first person
Didnt people just eat it back then
unless you cut it with something
but like you'd be forever attached
i imagine it would probably just heal over time
Or am I completely wrong
Didn't the bible mention that they used bread
wait if your belly button is your umbilical cord snipped and tied then like how did cavemen do it
The Japanese astronaut caught the boomerang
what?????????
In 1992, German astronaut Ulf Merbold performed an experiment aboard Spacelab that established that boomerangs function in zero gravity as they do on Earth. French Astronaut Jean-Franois Clervoy aboard Mir repeated this in 1997.[20] In 2008, Japanese astronaut Takao Doi again repeated the experiment on board the International Space Station.
the tech
You could miss
its just gonna kaclangle on the floor
its not gonna come back
cause if youre throwing them at somebody
war boomerangs make no sense
Having your weapon come back to you is like the moon landing of antiquity
imagine?
Imagine inventing the boomerang
it gets a pass purely for that narrative cleverness
how could a boomerang POSSIBLY have any realistic plot relevance within the context of the hardy boys
The most Chekhovian item
Like I think one time he got really into boomerangs and not only did the boomerang itself come back, but the notion did as well
And it was always relevant
And Chet had a new obscure hobby half the time
Yo I read like all the Hardy Boys books
it'll have importance later
so if you discover something of a bit of interest
but more in terms of chekhovian things
i talk about it a lot
yea like two separate ideas that you just learned feel really common
Everything you recently learned should be eligible for the effect
Like separate instances?
can you have multiple at once
Can you only achieve the effect once per thing / factoid or as many times as you can stop paying attention to it and then rediscover it
yaseen IS the writer
wait nvm
and then there was an article about african alligators on the front page of reddit

I was gonna say "to exist" but even that's not correct
The sole criterion for something to be an instance of the phenomenon is to exist as a thought
And if not then it isnt
Okay if you hear of it again outside of this chat next week its conclusively real
not unless i hear about the phenomenon again in the next week
Well, it is, right
For a moment I thought you were saying that the phenomenon was an example of its description
Because I feel like the summation of these biases is who I am
Looking this up brought me to the Wikipedia list of cognitive biases and its pretty troubling to soak in all at once lol
Is it probably because its a phenomenon where its really hard to notice when it doesnt happen, and because we often pay less attention to words or things we dont know, so we are more likely to notice after we learn them
So with the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon
The only thing we can believe in is that we didnt start the fire
We definitely started a fire then couldnt figure out how to do it again
nah. we didn't start the fire.  it was always burning since the world was turning
at one point humans started a fire and from then on theres been a fire burning somewhere on earth ever since
Captain Zack is from the bayou state

NJ is the garbage state

the last frontier or the final frontier
dang what was named first
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_territory_nicknames
Alaska is just The Last Frontier
Colorado was sometimes called The Highest State pre-weed
Omg
Missouri is the Show-Me State
I think Cali NY Florida and Texas are well known since theyre big but some of these are sus
Which state nicknames do you guys know
Wait what
Just found out Pilates is a name and not a set of pilates
maybe if you memorize a shit ton of songs to the point where all the common phrases are covered
Could you live out a full day only by humming
Mmmm mmm means tastes good
Mm mm
Uhh uhh
How do you hum "no"
Mhmm means yes

They make your hands cooler too
They probably keep your hands a little bit warmer?
Apparently theyre good for exercising
i really don't like them tbh??? like why do they exist
I didnt know they existed in real life
Theyre so cool
Cool
I started googling it and sleeves with thumb holes came up but dont let this be a gordian knot

What do you call sleeves that have thumb holes
All 4 things were mega
This is MeGa
This is a switch cartridge *dies*
This is a game cube controller
This is a foot
Allen can i blindfold you and feed you things and you guess what they are

i love calamansi
Kalamansi
There's a shitton of citrus similar to oranges
Not orange?
tomato is the most distinctive flavor
How would you rate it
Wanna get into the lobster
imagine saying u were gonna mate with someone
Allen wyd
That's what i like to hear
watch it andy
But this could be that something
I always have something to do
Isn't it mutually beneficial for 2 desperate people to just mate
yea i mean if you had to watch that vs do nothing i'd watch it
Do you recommend it
and then it finished and i was still like what
it was one of those movies where i was like uhh what
uhhhh maybe
Did you like it
uhhhh it's just really weird
How is it
yea i've seen it
Anyone ever heard of this movie

We don't have the resistances
Humans are more sensitive to dirt and other particles than other animals
I feel like hat's been asked by humans many times before but when I google it I don't find an answer at first glance
Do humans sneeze more than other animals


And now for the folks just tuning in
I love speaking in exposition irl to make this valid

Maybe this bug is the ugd
It's part of the UGD storyline
But it got a kick ass goofy mask outta the deal
This spider seemed to have been taken over and killed by a parasitic fungus


Something bad happens, and then he fixes it
A lot of it was just exploring the universe with his companions
And i watched the whole first season
Idk how he even stops them
Like tbh
He doesn't do any deduction really
Doctor who basically just stops evil aliens
All I really know is that there are statue demons
What is doctor who actually about
Just make sure it doesn't become doctor who
The story is so solid
It can be whatever
I guess a lot of detective stuff is episodic
For some reason I just assumed that this is a tv show
Plus the only thing that clearly caused by something is the beginning of the universe so it makes sense that hed be interested in it
And he would use a lot of parallels between cause and effect in science and in people to explain why things happen
Oooooohh 
I think the central theme would be everything is the consequence of something else, or like that would be the detectives philosophy and his process for understanding peoples motives and behavior
That wasnt a question that was an answer
Just a scarf
Thasmyshit
A scarf
A suit and trench coat?
How are you imagining him
Does the detective even need a name
You're already crafting the science that will be used to make the mystery extra thicc
Allen allen allen
Except things get weird closer to the center so its harder to go near there
The travel technology in this universe is pretty advanced so people can travel really far pretty easily
How does the detective travel
Yeah
Is the detective human
As the two travel together, she acts in ways that manage to surprise the detective, causing him to reconsider whether humans are so simple after all
What's the detective's name
This sounds so hype ohmwygawd
Yo yo yo yo yo
And call it alien
Helll you can make up chemistry and science
All you have to do is research a little bit about chemistry and you could write the best mystery series in the universe
Yo have you read any Arthur conan


He realizes that the mysteries are connected 
Until
So to begin with she just bugs him and he tries to get rid of her
Because he feels only a question of that scope is worthy of him
YOOOOOO
And she finds out that since retiring hes been trying to learn the truth about the creation / nature of the universe
After he disappeared for about 10-15 years the main character of the story looks for him because she wants him to solve a mystery about her past
He has a cynical personality and thinks that people are too predictable / solvable
A detective became famous throughout the universe for being able to solve a bunch of high profile cases, but he quit because he wasnt challenged at all
Okay my idea is um
Captain Duck Edgar Dumas Aloysius Eoghain Dodgers - (voiced by Joe Alaskey) A hapless soul that was accidentally frozen for over three centuries for reasons not known. He was later revived by Dr. I.Q. Hi in the 24th century. Dodgers is arrogant, selfish, greedy, lazy, cowardly, gullible and not particularly intelligent. However, he occasionally displays surprisingly high levels of heroism and competence, suggesting that he is not quite as daft as he appears to be, although he mostly succeeds through sheer dumb luck and the work of the Eager Young Space Cadet. Though he doesn't show it often, Dodgers cares deeply for his cadet, even though he often demeans and puts him through humiliating situations. He is played by Daffy Duck.
No ducks
No stop
What about duck dodgers
My mind goes to ducktective by default so idk if that's a good idea
You go first
Allen could you think of a cool plot for "universe's greatest detective"
When L said he was the top 3 detectives in the world that was the peak of hype
Omg that reminds me
Google
The greatest detective
If anything Thao put in more effort than me
Google solved it
Actually Yaseen solved it
Could he have solved the shirt
And noone would be able to question it
Why is batman just allowed to be the "world's greatest detective" just cuz the writers are always able to have him solve crimes(that arent complex tbh) One of his villains actually gives him RIDDLES to help him Someone should make a character called universe's greatest detective
F is assumed
I missed F lol

What word do you think of
If someone said don't say the a word
Alcatraz
What is the a-z word
Sometimes belief is more substantial than actuality
That's true
I'd like to believe it said what you thought it said
Is any conjecture ever truly for nothing
While I would be happy for you to be at ease I'd also be sad if all of this conjecture was for nothing
Oh maybe I just read it wrong lol
I've googled the exact phase and there are loads of shirts that pop up that way "Feminism is my second favorite f-word"
But that seems like a bit of a stretch
The only thing I can think of is something like equality because then it can convey what the ideal goal is while acknowledging that feminism is necessarily to push against existing inequities
Maybe the goal of the shirt is just to make you think this deeply about feminism
The favorite word should be something deeper or wittier or at least something that justifies the structure like if your second favorite word was dog and your favorite was hot
Which would mean the favorite word could be something related like women but that doesnt feel right because then I dont know why it would be introduced in such a roundabout way
If we accept the assumption that the favorite word is supposed to be derived from that, which might not be the point then I think the safe initial step is to also assume that the appreciation of the word is for its meaning and not literally as a word
Saw a shirt that said feminism is my second favorite word and I cant stop thinking about it
Does air slash work
Huehuehue
Does metal slash work on Foxs legs
I would know
Hotpot
Or eggs
Chicken sandwiches
Probably like
wait is any food that
Sounds rigorous enough
I'm just gonna define it as can you eat a ludicrous amount of it without keeling over and dying
I know healthier is like the most nebulous concept lol
Ketchup would def be way better I think
Actually fuck that
What's the definition of healthier
What if the ketchup was also homemade
Or rather  Ketchup is better unless the fries are homemade or something
I'd say generally yes unless the fries are prepared in like a fast food context
Healthier is the trouble word
Is ketchup healthier than fries
Might be better to do just lard
From a purely macronutrient standpoint you could argue you get carbs from chips but theyre empty calories with no micronutrients and a bunch of sus ingredients
Its the same amount of lard either way
If it's 100% lard vs a percentage of it lard and a percentage of it is better than lard then i suppose so
This is still if the rest of the meal was lard btw
Like you might be putting more garbage in your body but youre also getting a marginal amount of stuff that isnt the top of the food pyramid
How so
But if it was a meal wouldnt including chips be beneficial
You could define so many foods under that statement
Unhealthy is a weird term though
if youre looking at it in the context of a snack then basically any additional food is unhealthy because you could eat nothing
At this point that's barely related to the subject but I needed someone to know
It's weird
So he ate some fries and he was able to just demolish the rest of the sundae
He was at the point where he couldn't finish some huge sundae
I just watched a podcast the other day that mentioned some professional speed eater
wait it's the opposite i'm dumb
it's like 1 lard 1 candy vs 2 lards
it's not like 1 lard 1 candy vs 1 lard
Like specific flavor combinations will make you inclined to eat more
Chips can also make you eat more so that's something to consider
That would be the worst
Well lard and lard
Yes
Yeah but would it be worse for you to eat lard and chips than lard
like imagine eating lard and candy
i feel like it decreases the healthiness yea
No, it just makes it less unhealthy imo
If you ate an unhealthy thing and a slightly less unhealthy thing does the second thing increase the healthiness of your meal
oh yea the non beverage ones jk
what about the ones with snacks and cup noodles
sorry the old ones aren't
so the old ones and the beverage ones are refrigerators
Maybe not old ones
Most ones that have beverages cool them
Like, does it cool the food?
does it?
Depends if it refrigerates its contents
Yyyyyyyyyyyes
Is a vending machine a fridge
Were like a step away from HD rage comics
Feel like it came back when Trump got elected lol
I cant believe u mad came back to life in 2019

with absolute ease

Theres playing my son in bracket
Relatively
Relative ease even more so
Easy is relative
Like no matter what perspective you look at it from, it was easy

What is absolute ease
Is that what makes it relative, instead of absolute ease
That was only really done with relative ease depending on when you begin assessing the difficulty
I popped that icicle bicycle in that shit like donkey Kong with relative ease
And it got to the ideal shape in seconds
Just run it under some warm sink water
But my cousin was like
And I was trying to melt it in my hands
I was trying to get an ice quarter circle into my water bottle but the overall area was too great for the circumference of the bottle
We did it
That's it
Metalgarurumon
Antiexoreduo'
Cognative
Cogna can evolve into cognac or cognate
Well that was just an exampy
How many words really start with that though
Antidisestablish-
Well then can you just look for the longest combination of prefixes you can add to any word
Ideally there should be no correlation between what the words mean unless its somehow coincidental
So we're not including different suffix versions of words
Is there a pair of words that remains unclear for more letters without being like malicious and maliciously
That's the "unclear"  , part
Exactly
Pregnant and pregnable arent the same word though
Well it's just any long word that can have a different suffix right
Not counting two versions of the same base word of course
The best I thought of was impregna-, but there must be something better
A while ago I was thinking about how deep into a word you can get without the word becoming clear
I like to eat opples and bononos
Pay Jay Mays
Imo more of the permutations sound viable than you might expect, but some are pretty bad
Theres two common pronunciations of pajamas but if you applied the a decision to all 3 As there would be 8 possibilities


what is dapping?
Just found out dapping isnt punching
Except in life other routes arent as explicitly defined so its easier to not know youre missing information
Like legitimately I think 3H contextualizes how little its possible to know about other perspectives
You can only play one route
It feels like politics have never been easier to get into but it's also difficult to understand all perspectives
cause everyone put so much of their own opinions into it
like when i was trying to find out about the venezuela stuff i was like actually i have no idea what of this is real
Or other actors named Tom
also sometimes there's so much misinformation or perspectives on stuff that you don't know what is real
Thats definitely why I didnt know any Tom Hanks movies
like a bunch of times the reason you don't know about something going on is cause it's not being talked about and that's not your fault
i feel like the obligation to know is way less than the obligation for media to let ppl know
But if youre in politics it immediately becomes a much worse look
So like, regardless of how much access to information you have, if you clearly arent in a position to act, it doesnt really matter what youre aware of or not
It seems to me that as far as societal obligations go, youre only obligated to know about things insofar as you have the potential to influence them
But I really dont know how most people work
I think it's more of a case where it's correct and favorable to do so but not poor if you don't
Is it wrong of someone to not know or make a reasonable effort to know
I'd say in general people have to know about the headlines and things that are trending
Depends on the intelligence and awareness of your circle
To what extent are people obligated to know about international issues
DLC
roy's fastfall speed is like the most egregious instance of one-upmanship

Joker has the same multiplier as Link in Ult
at least in smash 4
lol
everyone except link
well I think it's the same multiplier for like
I think it's character dependent
omg
Tetris invented fast falling
Or is it like a variation of the ground pound
Did sakurai invent fast falling
would the ability to fastfall be in considerably more games
How much strength does it take
Or is it difficult to do
that was probably what compelled Edison to discover it
Assuming that the force is being created from nothing
We could theoretically harness it as energy
so everything up until that point is the same
It was invented by Thomas Edison
And not something we just have from the beginning
Upon humanity
Wait so the power is bestowed
Probably at least one person would die from some dumb stunt and that alone would change everything a lot
Or swings
See saws would be more fun
Or you could jump on someone twice as hard
You could perform more powerful axe chop/overhead attacks by jumping first
Like if we're already falling as fast as possible
Would it ~double our terminal velocity
no toggle
Or could we toggle it
Do we have to be locked in fast fall speed
I'm pretty sure it's less than double
Is it double
How much faster is fast falling
oh actually paratroopers might be marginally more effective

well I feel like most minor changes you could make to history would have dramatic impact on everything, but the ability to fastfall also seems like it would change so little
Seppuku
In what circumstances would you ever want to fast fall
how different would the course of human history be if people could fastfall but physics was otherwise unaffected
https://youtu.be/4v92gXetGqA
I highly recommend it
It's bigger brain than inception
Has anyone seen swiss army man

Im gonna need that

The Paul vs twisted hero tournament match that Falln thought was a combo video
Bunny season
is there a consensus on the sickest combo video ever
They extend your lifespan by 3 hours
if you see a sick combo video your body starts producing salt
Do combo videos make you healthier
*me and allen walking into a bar*
What if you see a sick combo
If you even so much as see a picture of a sick person, youre immune system starts producing more antibodies
It isnt always but sometimes if I think about spicy food I can taste spice
Same here
I dont feel anything on my tongue
and basically i feel like it's that but less for spicy
cause i do
do you feel uncomfortable thinking about sweets or candy
I never had that what is this power
like literally
dimitri has no sense of taste
Ill think about spice on a regular basis but the mental image will gradually become ice cream
I want a spice tingle from ice cream thoughts
How pavlovian
it's just like you form links between stuff and it works the opposite way
Well there must be
isn't there totally a neurological process for this
The tongue thing and yawning when you think about it feel like glitches
In theory can we just trigger our taste sensors
Like what is the neurological process for this
actually like that's way more than spicy food for me
i can make my tongue tingle thinking about sweet food
How come you can make your tongue tingle by thinking about spicy food but other flavor thoughts have no effect
But you have no control over how it does it
A button that would solve any problem
That sounds like an interesting premise
Thats the issue
Yeah like, there's no button that could give you the connection
Sometimes the notification just takes a couple seconds to come and you're FUCKED
Well in that case don't you have to just mash
It's open but then after you connect you get the notification I was talking about
Try connecting to MTA wifi
No that's for connecting to wifi with a password
Do you see different screens than this

I just dont like when Im awkwardly connected so I cant use 3G but the verification doesnt come up so Im trapped
There will be a notification or something that you can click to get taken to the verification page
Android sometimes has a button for it
A button to what
I eventually get it but I wish there was a button or something to press
And it generally will pop up when I search something
I just try to use a browser
Or Im seeing the page to agree to terms for the WiFi when it finally appears
Well either Im seeing an error page because I dont have internet
Screenshot what you're seeing
A lot of the time I have to keep trying and failing to use internet until it appears
Does anyone know how to force the authentication page to show up when you get on public WiFi
the liquid on the other side pushes down and forces it up there
How is it staying in the handle
wait why would it be floating
Is the tea in the handle floating

like MOTHERFUCKER
the sad thing is that we're at the sage where some people who used to deny it or denied that it's man-made now say it's too late to fix it
Yo, fuck climate deniers

And its very different when youre debating which one is better when you both have all the information, vs. when you have no idea what the other persons side is but you double down anyway
I dont think its a bad practice, it just illuminates a side of people Id rather not look at
I loved arguing for arguments sake and still do to an extent
Especially useful since a lot of games cater to already immature and passionate teenagers and young adults
Marketing it as fun and light hearted seems to be the way to reap all the benefits without any drawbacks
Although for the same reason it seems like really effective marketing because people like to align themselves and when people debate Sword vs. Shield its Pokmon that stands to gain from the buzz
Yeah I agree
Its like a failure of perspective
Well 3H makes the problem more explicit because people see one house and decide its the best which is the same as how people think their own country is the best or the worst or whatever
I feel like 3H is slightly different cuz youre supposed to see every house but still its weird
I totally feel that
Because in that context its just games but I feel its the same core compulsion that drives ethnocentricity
Even though its mostly not serious it kind of bothers me how faction choices in games like in 3H and Pokmon Go expose jingoism in people
Rabbits are good at kicking
do animals have fighting skills
Frogs wrestle for territory
Based purely on how effective they are
So even if cats dont have a rigorously defined style they could arguably be using martial arts
Kangaroos box
Well almost all martial artists learn existing styles but if you invented your own you would still be a martial artist
I think it'd be hard to measure the former but the latter exists albeit genetically imo
I think the criteria for a martial art is either meeting a certain threshold of overall proficiency / skill or belonging to an established style or both
Kung fu Panda babyyyy
It depends on your definition of martial arts I think, there's nothing animals really establish or codify but there do exist common and practical self-defense methods animals use. We could deem those martial arts
Do animals know martial arts

The citys regional herbs also feature heavily in its local cuisine, which is also generally disliked by younger people
However its specialization toward health and generally traditional culture attract a relatively elderly population, leading city youths to leave in search of more contemporary places to live
In fact, the city was first established due to the abundance of useful herbs that grew in the surrounding area
Starflower, also known as the verdant city, is considered to be at the forefront of scientific and medicinal innovations

What's a good name for a city
Did you find your way
To the light we go
Don't be lost

I like the seed
Omg I was so distracted by linguistic minutiae that my days since taking the train the wrong way got reset
actually the only language with enough ppl for that would be chinese or spanish
what if we had a chat like the voice chat but for some language so ppl could learn
I always get tripped up in Chinese because in English reading things is unidirectional but in Chinese when you read a percentage you have to say percent first and its like in Arrival where understanding the language isnt just straightforward
Just use all

Oh shit
https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Technology
What do they call walkie talkies in naruto
Wait Allen youre so right
Ahhh
Did they skip desktops or what
Just thinking about it makes me angry
By any means necessary
If I made Boruto the first thing I would do is retcon laptops
What does that mean
All their technology is scroll based haha
No
Have you seen boruto lol
Yo I forgot to attach the scroll to my last email 
Isnt that fucked up
Which leads me to the conclusion that digital files are called scrolls in Naruto
Then I thought its pretty unreasonable to imagine a world that developed computers before other components of modern society but then I remembered that happened in naruto
Which made me think if somehow computer science outpaced physical office implements and functions, would computer terms just be named differently or would we have no capacity to conceive of those things
Like a lot of concepts are straight analogues of physical things, like documents and files
I was going to say isnt it interesting how much of computer terminology is based on physical office stuff
I feel like I reached enlightenment in the worst sense
Omg I just had a revelation

The down arrow denotes downloading

Theres no way thats saving
Wtf
I see a down arrow a lot
Would you not use it
If you had to denote saving with an icon
I dont really see it anywhere
Idk what to think because the floppy disk has grown too powerful, but also I wouldnt think itll last forever
Lol 2 days ago a Japanese kid asked if its a vending machine and it went viral
Now image search nami

Hasnt it tho
When will the save icon change
English is the best
In my Chinese class we went over colloquial and formal ways to say some terms but for most things I would only ever know one way
Especially because when youre learning a language I feel it usually takes a long time before you learn a second way to express something
Its interesting how if youre fluent in a language you intuitively have a sense of how normal individual words like joke and jest are, but when youre learning a language you dont know so you just use a random concoction of slang and extremely formal terms
I thought about it and almost got sucked into the Mesolithic era
it was so good
Remember stumble upon
it was a jest
It wasn't, but how big of an idiot would I look like right now if it were Pocahontas
Wasn't that Pocahontas
Basically what it's like to be mixed
Resulting in his tribe leaving him and his family/place of origin believing he's too Native American to return
And he spares the life of a white kid against the wishes of his tribe
Where a white kid gets kidnapped by Native Americans
That reminds me of a novel I read freshman year of high school
And neither the rich nor the lower class would be satisfied
You'd have to have the exact median income to do that
No one will ever be able to say finna jest
Thats a powerful combination
Lemme get away with some insider trading and ill be rich enough to use jest AND finna
Chilllll lmao in another timeline for sure
#IAmStern yaseen
We have to stick to words like   finna
Neither of the people in any of my conversations have any money whatsoever to be saying words like that
it's like the same statement but coming from a higher position
At my income class it's only aggressive
it's more bourgeois than aggressive
hey jesters are fuckin cool
That's pretty disrespectful lol
You're comparing someone to a jester
"You jest" is actually so aggressive
yeah, but like, by how much?
Like, you jest feels more aggressive than youre joking
Honestly saying you jest sounds better than you joke
*joke
I feel like using jest in an accusatory manner is more aggressive than using jokw
also jest is more commonly used to accuse other people of jesting rather than what you're doing
I'll still say it though
People should always know you're joking
well my original point was you never need to say it
When would you ever need to say jest
But saying jest means you're saying you're joking
it's like when you use a combat art in 3h
Sometimes before I use a word like jest I weigh the potential satisfaction to be derived vs the damage it'll do to my sentence but then I almost always go for it
it also depends on what age they are i guess
We're definitely privileged enough to be educated on the implications of our actions and words
Out of touch or unaware of social implications sure   But just poor quality people overall is too much imo
most stereotypes are statistically likely
That's really subjective
like the chance someone says the r word but is a good person isn't 0 but like it's pretty low
but like if you hear someone say that then i feel like statistically it's likely that they're bad
There are a lot of people who drop the r word constantly but are perfectly good people
I feel like someone's vocabulary sorta says where they're from and what's commonplace for them and has less to do with who they are
i feel like it's impossible to not instinctively draw conclusions or something like that about someone's personality based on stuff they say
like there's lots of cringe stuff out there but if someone speaks or posts cringe, take it from someone who's done it countless times, it's almost 100% likely they'll later feel way more uncomfortable and confused with what they said than you did hearing it
Place*
Which is why allen even questioned it in the first jhave
the only time i feel like people should try and draw conclusions from someone's vocabulary is when it includes slurs
Yeah justin is absolutely correct
Like, its reminds me of people who were just pretentious jerks cause thats where ive heard it if that makessense
If i heard someone say it i wouldnt be all "hes def an asshole" but id definitely be kinda confused.
I don't think anyone seriously cares about it but it's just kinda outside the sphere of contemporary vocab
there's jest in cs and i can't think of any other time it's not horrible
like what's the big deal
like it might just be because 90% of my life is a cringe comp so i sympathize with it but that's such a sad thing to judge people for
i mean... i'm not gonna make that assumption so quickly... and i don't think anyone else shit
Lowkey it just sounds like that self important asshole nerd from highschool who though they were better than everyone
but like, what exactly is the problem with jest?
Just like how all smash terms are some old melee brawl shit
but my best guess is that it's some super old warcraft 3 shit
Apparently it could be short for "process" would could = trigger/activate
Looked it up quickly
Do you have any idea
basically it's almost always used incorrectly but it's too late to stop
I saw a discussion about this a few years ago
And where does it come from
What does proc mean
There exist very few if any situations where jest would cover bases that joke wouldn't
I think a lot of the issues with it is that it's super annuated by the word "joke"
y
i don't think that far ahead, i just think it sounds funn
It definitely does
i guess?
but doesn't that reinforce that using it regularly puts you in danger of sounding like a smug nerd
if you're doing an impression of a smug nerd you could facetiously say "huhuh, SURELY u JEST"
I think if someone replies to something you said sarcastically you could say "you jest, but" and it could slide under the rug
i like the word jest, so i'd like to believe there's lots of moments to say it
A renaissance fair
Is there any legitimate time to say jest
I mean the problem is more complicated than "savagery" or mental illness. It's a unique facet of human society
i just think they crazy
Thinking about it in those terms helps me process the savage things that humans can do
We can and should hold ourselves to a higher standard, but ultimately we're a component of nature
but I think that humanity acts as though there's a bigger gap between humans and other animals than there really is
I wanna be really careful with how I word this because I'm not trying to condone killing
and I don't think it's just that I got more jaded or w/e but
Not that they're "acceptable" but when I think about it I couldn't accept them before
I feel like I can accept that they happened
in what sense?
I feel like recently my reaction to news about killings has shifted
and now massacres happen so frequently that i have trouble differentiating between them
The VA Tech shooting happened while I still wasn't really plugged in, same with columbine
anyway
it's a pretty weird memory
and unless my memories are mixed up she eventually gave me like a Pizza Hut coupon because of that
I felt so sad and confused that I somehow ended up writing down how I felt and giving it to my homeroom teacher because I didn't know what else to do with it
and that was the first high profile incident that I was really aware of since I was too young during Columbine
When I was in 7th grade the VA Tech shooting happened
hard to believe that happened 5 years ago
and I guess it's pretty topical unfortunately
I ended up reading about the Isla Vista shootings again yesterday
Infas
imagine calling starvation an involuntary fast
like all else on the subject aside the phrasing of involuntary celibacy actually stuck
I can't believe incel has made it as a term
on a related point to the meteoric thing
it did APPEAR in a movie though
uh it was the "music video" section of the wikipedia article for Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger. I should've only clipped out the relevant parts but:  the answer is no, the album with HBFS on it and the music video aren't from a movie
wait what's the relation
The animated music video for "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" was produced by Daft Punk and directed by Kazuhisa Takenouchi, a veteran director for Toei Animation, under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto. It features the four characters shown on the single cover in a vast electronic facility. There, they are transformed by various machines to resemble humans. The video was first released as an individual episode in promotion for the single release. It later appeared as a scene in the feature film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem.  A music video for the live version of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" was directed by Olivier Gondry. It contains footage shot by the audience on 250 cameras at Daft Punk's Brooklyn performance in KeySpan Park. The video was inspired by the Beastie Boys concert film Awesome; I Fuckin' Shot That!.[1] The video had its world premiere online on 26 October 2007, at Webcastr.[10]  "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" is featured in a popular YouTube video titled "Daft Hands",[11] which later appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[12] The video was ranked among the top viewed YouTube videos in the "All Time" category.[11] "Daft Hands" was referenced in Weezer's "Pork and Beans" music video along with the variant "Daft Bodies" and multiple other Internet viral videos.
Isnt the album from a movie?
O
no
do you like how it relates to the Harder Better Faster Stronger music video? that's my favorite daft punk song and video
the entirety really
what about it in particular?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8
can we discuss the One More Time music video while we're here
Like I thought of "The Rolling Stones" but that's not gonna work on a ship
probably ship name
uhhhh
Led Zeppilin
which category is the most restrictive
Daft Punk
but fuggit
I'm cheating by picking names that have already been used
Nirvana
Death Grips
Heaviest metal
starflower
What could you name a band, ship, and guild
Sensitive
What's the opposite of numb
No
So it did its job
Like I've never used "meteoric rise" I think but I've read it many times and got what the person was saying
Does it count as being useful if I see someone else use it and they convey meaning to me through their use of it?
Its not useful if no one uses it
Cut it out of your lives
No one has said this
that's a good point, i didn't consider that
Like I agree that the element of surprise is there, but it feels more like its that the rise is surprisingly fast, rather than fast and surprising if that makes sense
But for nonphysical things, I think almost always if it rises quickly, the surprise factor is necessarily there because if it wasnt we would perceive it as rising in popularity at normal speed
well yeah, but the phrase is still useful
Thats more because physical things dont have meteoric rises
i'm srs
a rocket
Well what rose quickly but not meteorically
that's why it had a "meteoric rise"
like when someone talks about pubg becoming a thing. it wasn't just fast, it was also something people didn't really expect or pay attention to until it was already underway
it's both
I feel like the meaning is more about the speed
like a major part of "meteoric" as an adjective is the surprise factor
yeah but again, we know where volcanoes are and more or less when they're gonna splooge.
You could say volcanic
Because geyser is also a decent comparison but geyserlike is just too ugly
Moreover rocket isnt conducive to good adjectives
like a meteor falling out of the sky
The thing is, you typically know when and where a rocket's gonna launch. The phrase "Meteoric rise" usually is used with the connotation of something coming out of left field or growing in a surprising way
That was my first thought but Wikipedia says the Big Bang wasnt an explosion
Theory
The Big Bang
What was the first explosion
A rocket??
This is like how everyone gave up on fighting literally meaning not literally
Blueface baby
West Coast Best coast
West coast would ascend meteorically
Must be a west coast thing
Ive never heard of this
I think what it comes down to is whether or not you value the fact that its already an established phrase because if so theres no need to rock the boat but if you dont give it the benefit of that then its hard to defend
Like if it was a more general term Id think it was more okay for meteoric rise to be a thing but it the word is used almost exclusively for rising
Barry what you said was my initial take and pretty much my response but in the end its still comparing the rise of something to a meteor and the fact that meteoric isnt used for descents makes it weirder
I only talk to Falln on wechat now
wait why is that notification from wechat LMFAO
i know it shouldn't be kosher but i'm kinda okay with "meteoric rise/ascent." i don't feel like there's a word that conveys the sudden burst of speed of something falling out of the sky but in the "up" direction, so the oxymoron is okay with me.
Wait now that i think of it fuck that
Or not really often but its a common enough expression
People say meteoric rise pretty often
I've never heard that before
At first I thought it was fine, but the more I think about it the less acceptable it is
I never questioned this phrase until now

That's bonkies
Caterpillars disintegrate and reform
That's just multiplication
Where they do that at
Thats fucking crazy
Bro you can just have sex and the sperm and egg together just have the capacity to make a child
iirc how they do that is still basically a mystery
Also is wild that caterpillars basically melt and reform do butterflies
https://twitter.com/tenco15/status/1160075560594243584?s=19
So they don't need to learn to walk as quickly
Humans have longer lifespans than most animals and they spec more stats into brains
i'm gonna need some elaboration on that
Are humans are the only animal that has to learn to use its primary form of transportation?
I guess in less developed areas they could live shorter
Thatd be interesting to know
I wish there was some statistics about if doctors live longer
I suppose they dont prevent fires
But firefighters could die from fire more than average people
Youre either a crossing guard, a life guard, or dead
Yeah I guess lifeguards drown less than normal people
You don't really hear about crossing guards getting hit
If we're measuring the average crossing guard versus the average person
So they are involved less than normal people
Crossing guards decrease the likelihood of traffic accidents
Besides if it counted it would skew it more heavily in favor of regular people
Then yeah its probably a fraction
No
Do you count witnessing as involved?
If thats true, if you consider how much more time theyre on the street than regular people, their per second chance of getting hit by a car must be dramatically lower
I would guess fewer
Are crossing guards involved in more or fewer traffic accidents than regular urbanites
Fuk anyone whos name starts with chris
there's no columbus here
YEEEAHH
Hey fuk u columbus
Ok
christian help me bully this idiot baby
Thats the joke Im assuming lel
He was italian
?
columbus was spanish tho idiot baby
It literally is just in Spanish
yea but your last name is literally not columbus
Columbus translated into Spanish is Coln
it's literally not columbus
Wym no lol
arrr
oh shit you right
Yes
NO
no
(My last name is Columbus)


dont even play
you guys know a colombus
wait what
Dont take them for granted
Reminder that we only have 3 months left to refer to the 20s
yea i think they don't
oh wait asians don't do that???
and that's last name only
i assume married doesn't count cause that's a lot too
oh u rite
i wonder what percentage of name changes are cis people
whoa what
Aside from newborns being given newly popular names, many adults change their names as well, some in order to cast off birth names they feel are old-fashioned. Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 844,615 people (about 1 in every 60 South Koreans) applied to change their names; 730,277 were approved. In 2010, 552 men changed their name to Min-jun, and 1,401 women changed their name to Seo-yeon.[1]
i feel like there's gotta be some names associated with stereotypes unrelated to their meaning
Its not really the same thing as names associated with stereotypes though
So names have more obvious connotations compared to the meaning of regular western names
Yeah but now Im curious too
In Chinese and I think Japanese the meaning of names is way more explicit
i was just thinking out loud
yeah i didn't necessarily imply i was asking you to tell me
Beyond my knowledge sadly but I might ask some Japanese friends
what is the "chad/brad" name in japan
like what's the stereotypical "nerd" name in japan
what's more interesting to me is what names a japanese person would associate with certain features. like how in america we associate certain names with nerds
Even though a stick figure has no discernible features
oh yea that makes sense
Japanese people meanwhile would go with Tanaka
Like if you draw a stick figure and ask someone to name them Americans might be like Bob
yea that makes sense
oh wait you mean they don't think of a generic person as white
whoa that's crazy
I read an article on this in regards to the ethnicity Japanese people see anime characters
Definitely not
is that still true for ppl in china if they imagine a generic person
you know how when you imagine a generic person, you imagine someone white
Nah cause like, beer isnt a soda
I thought that was like the only part
which is a big part of being a soda imo
carbonated*
yeah ketchup isn't even carbonayed
You could say this about apple juice
The only part of that that makes any sense is that its a liquid, and even thats sus
Soda has nothing to do with fruit

bernie's platform is a good starting point and that doesn't include the abolishment of private colleges
eh, baby steps. abolishing private institutions is something americans are terrified to death of because fox news and cnn have poisoned our brains irreparably
i get it. Also lets destroy all private educational institutions too so we dont gotta pay that fat nyu studebt
there are various schools of thought how to make those decisions without capitalism but i'm not nearly well-read enough to understand let alone explain them
"from each according to their ability, to each according to their need" is the famous quote. obviously it's more complicated in practice and some needs are subjective but the basic answer is that decisions are made democratically but with a bare minimum idea of civil rights (such as food, potable water, shelter, education, etc)
how is it decided who gets to use what and how much
but "State capitalism" like the USSR was is considered to be a necessary stepping stone between capitalism and socialism
Socialism is when the means of production (factories, sources of natural resources, land, etc) are owned in common, not by private entities or the state
so a stepping stone necessarily
Socialism is best defined as a way to achieve Communism
but there are multiple transitionary stages to go through
which would make me an anarchist
cause i always get "socialism is watered down communism"
I think the ideal communist utopia requires the dissolution of states
what is like a good concise way to describe differences between the two
It's complicated
uh
literacy went up to like 95% from 25% in the feudal era (which lasted until 1917)
barry are you a socialist or communist
yeah like 50% of scientists in the ussr were women
Also, can we get a national holiday that is just hating on people
Big if
The soviet union was p good about gender equality if i remember correctly?
Russia has had a general Women's Day since the Soviet Union
Omg st Patricks day beat New Years Day
And Mothers Day beat Fathers Day by 10%
ye, iirc he went to spain to fund his ships but he's italian
Yo a higher % of Americans celebrate Mothers Day than Independence Day
It looks like no federal holidays stopped existing
o jk
Wikipedia says only RI and Arkansas ever celebrated it
only ri celebrates vj day now or something like that i think
yea like vj day
I imagine some must have
Do holidays get retired
i thought that was a joke at first
oh yea when michael said the harry potter guy
Theres an American film maker named Chris Columbus
yea actually i've never heard of it as a name
Ive never seen someones last name be Columbus
I wouldnt guess America more than I would some European country
ok if you met a new guy and his last name was columbus, what country/race do you think he's from
Like hes associated but Marco Polo doesnt sound Chinese
Columbus doesnt sound American
I think the italian name is christoforo columbo
actually columbus is extremely american sounding now which ruins it trying to sound italian i guess
that's like the least pizza last name
How about mar 10   Super mario day
wait columbus is italian??? holy shit
Is he Italian
Theres guy fawkes day
Its kinda wild
The knights of Columbus wanted an Italian Hero for kids to like look up to and celebrate
Right and theres a push to change columbus day to indigenous peoples day.  Which i think is great. But only if we celebrate native peoples and dont just hate on columbus.  Like people burn him in effigy and shit.  We dont have holidays where we hate on objectively eviler people like hitler.
part of it is that he has a holiday i guess? like why does he have a holiday
Its hard because for a lot of people if you agree with them it reinforces their beliefs but if you disagree it causes them to double down, so the majority of possible interactions push people toward their own beliefs
also diverting responsibility from the whole colonialism thing
Yeah most people are too stubborn about their beliefs and values
But its disingenuous to attribute a lot of things that happened to native americans to him. A lot of it helps create a narrative where we divert Responsibility from the US government which really fucked native populations over
Yes he barely did anything good.
Yeah but at least theres a consideration for grey area before choices are made. At least thats the conflict
like it's barely even special i mean
columbus barely even did anything good
Well part of the reason for those movies is to stimulate less polarized thoughts toward those situations
You know whats funny. Movies like to explore moral grey areas and have us consider what we would do in these specific situations where good/ bad is not entirely clear cut.   Thats the way real life is a lot of the times but at the same time IRL we like to just put people and actions into categories of good and bad without any thought towards context.
Damn that adds another layer to those movies then
Columbus is a guy who had had hundreds of years of misfortune and genocide wrongly attributed to him.   He wasnt a good guy but hes certainly not a hitler either
Hes the guy that did the Harry Potter movies
Lowkey i barely remember Christopher Columbus

Yeah I guess you can move across the court much faster
Unlike soccer where there are postions dedicated to offense or defense. In basketball any given player/ position has to play both offense and defense
Theyre the head of the offense lol
i'm shook
wait are point guards not the guys who guard the points
Self-care, strength, love
I thought point guards were defensive
Power love and gratitude
a few. selfcare, breakthrough, health, connection, lessons, gratitude
What word do you see?
... andy?

that would make sense as an explanation
i feel like hatred of groups helps ppl feel like they belong and also that the group that they belong to is the good group
I tend to follow what evidence suggests but regardless even if race is indeed an innate concept in humans, theres no excuse for ideas of racial hatred/ superiority
Understandable
except white ppl idk if i can accept them 
i mean regardless of all the theory on races, we should just try to overcome the biological inclination to form racist cliques and love each other i guess????
like i would agree that race is like buckets and it's more like a spectrum but i feel like throwing out the idea that races exist would be making it a lot harder to look at or study differences maybe? idk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ab4rYDR0yY
but i feel like it still exists to some extent cause it's like reproductive isolation due to geographic barriers right?
i feel like the argument against races is that it's like overly reductive??? like yea it definitely is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfs3SSNB6rI
this guy has very good insights on this topic
fugg
it has some nonzero biological roots and that's it i guess
yea it's definitely very socially influenced
racial preference is def repressed genetically and more based on where you are raised
i definitely learned that racial preference in stuff like that is evolutionarily advantageous cause you help ppl who share a high proportions of genes like yours do good lmao
I actually think race is not a social construct.   Its an evolutionary trait to prefer people of your own race.   They do studies on babies and toddlers and results indicate that they prefer playmates of similar race (meaning similar phenotypic appearances.)   Racial hatred (aka what we define racism as contemporarily) and ideas of racial superiority   Are absolutely taught and learned. Not inherited at all.   But those baby studies possibly indicate that race and racial preference are rather inherent in humans.
"knowing someone's "race" does not provide comprehensive predictive information about biological characteristics, and only absolutely predicts those traits that have been selected to define the racial categories, e.g. knowing a person's skin color, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the markers of race (or taken as a defining characteristic of race), does not allow good predictions of a person's blood type to be made. in general, the worldwide distribution of human phenotypes exhibits gradual trends of difference across geographic zones, not the categorical differences of race; in particular, there are many peoples (like the San of S. W. Africa, or the people of northern India) who have phenotypes that do not neatly fit into the standard race categories. focusing on race has historically led not only to seemingly insoluble disputes about classification (e.g. are the Japanese a distinct race, a mixture of races, or part of the East Asian race? and what about the Ainu?) but has also exposed disagreement about the criteria for making decisionsthe selection of phenotypic traits seemed arbitrary."   i don't understand any of this but it was on the wikipedia page of "race and society"
also it's cold so they get big and have huge tiddies
like there's less heat and sun in europe
wait i'm confused like white ppl and black ppl are way different clearly tho
i wish i did enough reading that i could understand the world better
like the concept of "The West" and so on
the thing is i've been told that race (not ethnicity, but race) is pretty much entirely a social construct
like manually
yea like selective pressure is slow but like ppl were like ok u big, go fuck
i'm just really scared of misapplying theory i don't fully grasp
But people groups that were artificially selected to procreate
Taking millions of years
Like sea animals developing legs etc
It really depends on your scale of evoltion
also it was hundreds and hundreds of years of generations
idk i should trust you about this
not literal natural selection
the selection was super not natural tho
evolution/natural selection doesn't occur that quickly iirc
when i think african ppl are smaller than white ppl on average??????
and like physically large
Yup hence many Black people being athletic beasts
yea i agree with that like i think it led to some of the traits we associate with black americans today and not black africans
Additionally during trans atlantic slave trade the people more susceptible to disease died during transport
This is kind of controversial but slavery in way was a form of eugenics where they only allowed the stronger more fit men procreate with fit women.
every race has passives and traits
are black ppl more evolutionarily advanced like they literally have environmental protection in their skin that non black ppl don't and they have no tradeoffs for it

Certain species of Orbweaver spiders have even higher tensile strength than that Andy
A black widow spiders web is 12 times the tensile strength of steel
To scale, the distance between a nucleus and orbiting electron is 16 times longer than the distance between the Sun and Pluto
1 billion seconds is about 31 years
That light speed thing reminds me of calculus and approaching infinity
You are closer to being a millionaire than Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos
There are more trees on the earth than stars in the Milky Way
The speed of light is always the same, regardless of the relevant speed of the observer.  Say you're standing still, and a car passes you at 60 mph...it passes you at 60 mph, right?  Say you're driving at 30 mph and a car passes you at 60 mph...because you're already moving at 30, the car only moves away from you at 30 mph.  Light doesn't work this way. If you're standing still and turn on a flashlight, the beam of light moves away from you at light speed. But if you're moving at half the speed of light, and turn on a flash light, the beam still moves away from you at light speed, even though it's only moving at the standard speed of light. So even people who aren't moving half the speed of light see it moving at the same speed as you do, which isn't possible. But is somehow true.
singies
Line it up in singles twenties or hunnets?
If the earth is the size of a basketball, the moon is the size of a tennis ball
You can fit every planet between the earth and moon, including all the gas giants. But if you lined up all of Jeff Bezoss money from end to end, it wouldnt fit between the Earth and moon. It could go to the moon and back 34 times

If you said that 6 years ago of course you would say thats obvious but nowadays its like ...really??
Kids nowadays are playing Minecraft also, thats a thing to note
And marketing hasnt changed either
The game hasnt drastically changed since the last few years
his code was apparently horrible too
and went full neonazi
notch literally sold it and left
wtf
People who played it as a kid are with it for it to be popular
Nostalgia
Maybe cause they kicked notch out and went full corporate
Bra what happened
Subplot officially started
Like elu and the Stevens crew
There are so many groups of smashers here that talk about there Minecraft group server


Also I didnt even really realize it until Allen just said it but yeah it got popular in the smash community too
The game just started doing a lot better than it was before, not saying it wasnt doing good before @Andy Bow but it is doing so much better
So that got viral
Pewdiepie streamed it for a bit recently
Even outside the community
It resurfaced in the smash community because of Steve leaks and memes
Yeah thats always a thing but I mean internet popular
Like books and toys
There was plenty of minecraft nonsense
It was

Of course there is always Minecraft stuff but it wasnt popular a year ago
It might be over taking fortnite
Its back to being played everywhere on YouTube and Twitch
There's consistently been minecraft stuff
I work in a gamestop
The switch
I actually don't
It definitely had a comeback
You know what I mean
Never stopped
Guys why did Minecraft become popular again


wee knights
Happy birthday Thao!
Happy Birthday Thao !! May it be a auspicious year in your life.
HAAPPYYY BIRTHDAY THAO

Happy birthday thao!!!
Imagine August 3rd
no it's about the 0:77
like just about anything would explode by that point
i'm trying to imagine what would happen if you put something in the microwave for 7 minutes
honestly if i saw a guys microwave and 7 was wrinkled i'd still be pretty turned on
People who yank the door open instead of pressing stop are definitely bad influences
oh and the stop button
i think ive only pressed 1 and the +15 button
Odd numbers and 0
Do people not only press odd numbers on their microwave
my introduction to sexuality was when i had plastic covering on my microwave and the numbers like 0 and 1 and 3 were wrinkled cause we pressed them so much and i thought i want to marry a guy who presses 7 on his microwave
I only get bothered by shit I do that I deem irresponsible in terms of being a good guy
Shit like that got a lot easier when I realized that no one really cares at the end of the day
For me, memories of my "cringeworthy" moments deeply rot my brain. I wish I could forget some of the dumb shit I've done and said.
I mean i was a little kid so its not so bad and i probably forgot about it after an hour. But i do think moments like that probably influence us as we grow up. The tabooness of sexuality. Etc
is*
shame/embarrassment are definitely one of the worst parts of being one of the most social species on the planet
Actually now that i think back to it that was like my intro to shame.  I showed bulma titty to an older friend i looked up to and he was like whats wrong with you and then i was sad and felt ashamed
The end
I was in 3rd grade and i
They straight up didnt censor anything
My intro to sex was bulmas titties in dragon ball manga
When you trace the origin of a lot of cultural religious stigma it starts becoming ridiculous
Were through Barry.
i don't think i saw the second one
The concept of Sex began with that one scene of Velma in the second live action Scooby doo movie
sometimes being late to the party is good
this was how i felt about sexual urges but i didn't start masturbating until around 16-17 and by then i didn't feel ashamed of it
I was legit just scratchin an itch and then lo and behold I realized I opened up Pandoras box
When this happened to me I was so scared and ashamed bc of the sin I had committed

i think thats how i felt after discovering i could jerk my dick  as a young lad
"... and that was the world. And it was beautiful."
But are also blown away by the complex beauty of this new reality
You're scared to never see life as it was again
As you're overwhelmed with emotion
Even though you can no longer physically, but you still feel the tears
And you can't help but cry
Or maybe the first ever
As we all look forward together as one, for the last time
Some are scared of this unknown, an uncertain future, but their minds are gently put to ease
And it's a beautiful ignorance as our collective consciousness swirls around reminiscing of a past that fades away
Its like a dystopian virtual dream where everyone is in a digital drift after the last physical remains of humanity have settled into dust
This song makes me cry
https://youtu.be/PmzKsWSkROQ
I think that's technically possible but there was nothing erotic about the video for me
Wait Yaseen I thought you meant that was a sexual experience
You could download the entirety of wikipedia into a usb stick
So standing sex is looking like a requirement at this point
I was just watching an Athlean-X video where he talked about how all athletic movements are best done while standing to engage the core
Or so hard in the past
Youd think it'd be so easy to go to the moon in 2019
You know, with all the talk about the computing power of NASA being less than your phone
Have you ever had standing sex
Thats what I said
Orrr why not just join together in the first place
Oh right you could just go to the moon to have sex

The flying lotus
Princess carry over the threshold
That one would become really good
Whats the name of the position when the guy carries the girl
But maybe my perception of homes is too heavily skewed by a world in which we need to sleep
I think people would still have their own spaces
Rooms stem from a need for privacy, primarily while sleeping right?
Wait would we have rooms?
People used to just lay down on hay
That's the history of actual beds
I think normal people would primarily make do without having a surface for sex while wealthier people would develop sex beds but as civilization advances such surfaces would increasingly become seen as common household staples instead of luxuries
"If 1+1 didn't equal 2, what is 2+1"
But this question feels like
Actually if you didnt need to sleep would sex be predominantly while prone
And you could just do it on whatever surface
Yeah you'd still have your own room
Most people could get like futons
Well if you planned to have regular sex but have no need for a bed what would you do
Having sex on the couch is obviously still less sanitary
Depends, wed still in theory have to rest certain body parts after physical activity
A cushioned surface would still exist i think
No device related to resting would ever be needed
Well lets say you need to rest but not lose consciousness or verticality
Cause in that case we probably wouldn't even have couches either
In a world where people don't need sleep do they get fatigued at all?
If people didnt need to sleep would couches be much more heavily associated with sex or would there be furniture explicitly for sex
I feel like hocus pocus was made for Allen
Nothing should be able to kill at 20% without having some drawback

I could do without crit hits lol
If there were 4 heroes in doubles GFs it might look like a casual setup

imagine bayo comboing giant hero
Ding dong this
Or if you get poison the damage tick might ruin their confirm
Or maybe if you get big theyll be negative on hit
Can you essentially focus Attack if you run into an attack and hocus pocus and get invincibility
Ill get kamikaze
Yggdrasils Altar 2020
imagine being in the bottom left corner and you need zoom to recover and you're in the bubble so you can't even see the menu
At evo
imagine getting crit by giant hero
Ill never not hocus pocus
It can kamikaze
is hocus pocus net negative effects lmao
that's so sad tbh
I dont think so
wait can hocus pocus do curry
being invisible
Oh wait there was already mario utaunt but this is a first for ult
Cant believe being big will be in competitive play
That would mean its especially bad when Hero gets a mushroom from hocus pocus
is getting shrunken especially bad for him
Getting buried is extra bad for bowser jr
Even if you get piledriven
you could test damage in training mode right
probably
So would that hit the cart
in brawl it was like the opponent gets stuck to an additional bone on your model that corresponds to nothing and then that moves around and has a hitbox on it
There isnt just a hitbox where the throw is
Only some do and its a different hit from the throw hit
i'm 99% sure it's just a hitbox like normal
i think basically they all do
like mario's back throw i think does it
uh at least some do
it hits other ppl too right?
I imagine they're a unique mechanic rather than regular attacks, but I wouldn't know. I'm just a boy
No clue
Are they essentially like regular attacks but the hitbox only hits the person being thrown
How do throws actually work
Cart I think
Do throws hit Bowser Jrs cart or body
like the appendage became the center and grew a new appendage
justintv was a general purpose stream thing, and gaming stuff became so popular on it that they made a spin-off called twitch. now justintv is shut down and twitch has moved in the direction of being more general purpose streaming.  that's wild
That's what I'd like to know
What that
How

It probably just meant people acting that were not in a theatre setting
Uhh was live action role play a thing before animation?
Do you think the term live action was used before animation existed
Dora & Hobbs & Shaw

ooo
no i'm in cali
wait, are you still in vietnam?
it's going ok, visiting family is always bad
Hey thao how are ya
also dipsy and tinky winky are gay
wait why is dipsy being black and po being cantonese a sad react

Dipsy is black and Po is Cantonese
B up
PatG launch shuffle
smash launch shuffle
Insane launch shuffle on that bair
Prove it
DI got officially named launch shuffling in ult
lol
I believe in original smash 64 how to play tilt attacks were called STRONG attacks
Rar being one syllable redeems it
Ground rar
reverse grounded rush tho
rar was so bad as a name that now it's ok
Tilt
b reverse is ok
i didn't like perfect pivot as a name
Perfect shield is better
Oh wait the smasher term is powershield
Oh perfect shield is good  But idk if it is
Is perfect shield an official term
What about Maskys Instant Kill Sure-Hit Forbidden Invincible Technique
The only cool smash tech name is DI
Wave dash too but slightly less
Wavebounce is a dumb name
Tech
Wave dash
Wavebounce
W A V Y B R O  
Orobbaly that
Its like a noticeably high amount of something
Idk what figuratively constitutes a wave
Oh figuratively
it needs a frequency and an amplitude like it needs consistency i think???
Like goes to 1 then 0 then -1 then 0
Its that theres a lot and then a little
But when you talk about things coming in waves
Like thats what constitutes a wave
Like sine cosine
I thought its something that loops
Like is a mountain a land wave
Or is it anything with a crest
Anything with a lull
Like figuratively
What even is a wave
Theres a good young adult novel series about waves of human extinction enacted by aliens
We're running low on electromagnets over here
How many waves does it take to say I love you 
yesterday i was thinking about waves of feminism
How many waves is a song worth
No
Not an infinite wave, an infinite amount of waves
actually it's not a spoiler
but yea
is that a spoiler
interference ruins the signal which is why distance makes it bad
Is that what the guy did in stranger things
Just starting to read that made me very upset
but like if you pass current through a coil you create an em field
Its not an infinite wave eirher cause if so i could tune my radio to hear songs from new york rn
i didn't actually read this so idk if it's good???
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-create-electromagnetic-waves-and-manipulate-its-frequencies
Remove all waves from existence

Easily?!
yea actually idk how it gets aimed but you can make an em wave pretty easily
That's some alien shit
And like how do you aim it
Yeah but how do you create a machine that can create em waves
a change in electric field makes a change in magnetic field and vice versa
it's basically 2 waves
em waves are sent through the air
How do you even begin to fathom that
But how did they start sending them through the air
You send electrical signals through a wire
That shouldnt be a phrase
See like a get a telegraph
like you tune so that only that frequency has constructive interference
yea basically
What is an ocean but a collection of drops
Or like an infinite amount of waves in every direction
Lol
And like if you go to that plane you perceive other things on that plane? Or what
Does a wave emitter just emit one big omnidirectional wave
It seems like a plane of existence
But what does it mean to broadcast and what is the process for receiving it
But doesn't actually make sense if they were actually visible
Okay so a radio station broadcasts to a specific frequency right
Cause the way we visualize them makes sense for math and stuff
So a big thing for me is the visualization of waves
Same
Same
enough to fail physics :(
How much do you know about waves
And the award goes to thao for top most cool things said in this chat
Like all possible frequencies
What is the spectrum
radio and light are both on the electromagnetic spectrum
Like infrared or ultraviolet
But i'm pretty sure radio is actually on the sound spectrum actually
You did it
I lied
Oh yeah go for it
Well the light spectrum and the radio spectrum just show you a range of frequencies
I can explain it later
Thats right
Idk everything thats broadcast is on the spectrum right
Where did you hear about it
Can someone explain the radio spectrum to me in idiot terms
Both true
That autocorrected to Andys cortex right now
Andys correct
So yeah theater people are weird in a way more alien than even weebs
Alright Andys just posting pictures of senior prom Now I see

We need the Operation model
i guess that's like the monopoly model???
wait universal healthcare isn't free in all universal healthcare countries right like there's some non $0 copay
i guess it's like forms of america converting to universal healthcare
I mean under far leftist ideologies like anarcho syndicalism nobodys selling us anything. People are just given healthcare because its within our means to provide it assuming capital isnt the goal
like single buyer universal healthcare
isn't universal healthcare either a monopoly or a monopsony like either the government sells us all healthcare or healthcare companies all sell the government healthcare and then they give it to us

There should be a modern we didnt start the fire, with the old one as one of the items


Oh then you're right nvm
Allen
Where are you getting this "percieved" data
I cant just order McNuggets from anywhere
Wym negative
Thus its a separate product
Negative
There nuggets are perceived as different from regular nuggets
They could be called whatever
That's why they're allowed to price them
It's more important that mcnuggets are the most successful form of chicken nuggets
McDonalds is the brand
Its the product wym
But mcnuggets are the brand
To there ability to price them
Relevant to what
Specifically McNuggets
McDonalds monopoly on McNuggets is relevant
Wait Chris what is your point
AC as in the copyrighted product not the action
AC's are literally just fans with cooling chemicals in them
Fans dont have AC options
Or any form of chicken nugget
ACs have fan options
Mcnuggets specifically?
AC's are fans
McDonalds monopoly on McNuggets is relevant
You can condition air with a fan but what are you fanning with AC
Wait Chris what point are you trying to make
What
An AC can be a fan though
A fan is not an AC
Well its more like two brands of AC
But if someone really wanted an AC and one person sold it, then they are just fucked
The same way a fan is a substitute for AC
Regular nuggets are a substitute
Oh wait nvm
Mono-spony
Theoretically no
In reality yes
Sponsor?
Well they are though because they can sell generic nuggets for normal prices which is definitely keeping the price of McNuggets down
No other company is stopping McDonalds from raising the prices on McNuggets. And for anyone who would demands specifically a McNugget they would still have to buy
Is it a fusion of monopoly and sponsor
Also its all valid lol
Im pretty sure others will start selling it soon
And similarly Belle Delphine has a monopoly on her own bath water but how valid is that monopolistically speaking
Because you can say McDonalds has a monopoly on mcchickens and it could be correct but also not too relevant
Well for one thing isnt it kind of disingenuous to get that specific about the type of thing you can have a monopoly on
*sell
Why not. A persons patreon is a monopoly on the product they usually self
Its more straightforward if its just something only one person sells and one person buys
Well idk if a patreon really makes sense
Yes. Thats just a patreon with one willing backer
Can you have both at the same time
Its not as wild as you think
I heard about it with respect to the educational broadband service
i think i've only heard about the concept with respect to universal healthcare
just looked up the meaning and that's a wild concept
I just saw the word and I thought it was a typo
?
monopsony
Wouldnt it be so weird though if you were a stick person and someone drew a stick person
uh i'd say it's definitely easier to draw something perceived as "realistic" in that art style if it's a simplified art style
Realistic in universe
it depends what you mean by realistically???
I guess if its a simplistic art style, it might be easier to draw realistically but harder to draw not realistically
Is it easier to draw realistically in cartoons
https://medium.com/@christianlui/how-comfort-women-and-slave-labor-are-affecting-your-iphone-prices-ededd5d9168a
hey guys i wrote an article thing on Medium. In case any of yall are curious ill post it in here
Yeah that's like saying air is only useful when it's in your lungs
Isnt ice constantly melting when not in an environment where tempterature is freezing or below?
i never really thought of it as an old word
Well
It was translated to the modern day so we'll
Random thought but I'm happy the word "clout" came back into use and means what it more or less meant before it's resurgence
without melting
ice kind of preserves bodies
you could also use it to stab people
you could use ice if you want to make your water bottle have a round misshapen bottom
wait no jk i just looked it up and it's a common misconception lmao
Does it?
i think ice skating involves melting so not that actually
ok ice sculptures
yea it's like just coincidentally melting cause ice always does that
shaved ice is melting from the start
or really just the texture
the real use is the texture and taste
i guess it melts inside you but that's like after it's been used
what about shaved ice
I wish there was something humans do that I could discuss lol
although idk if that's like a use???
it can also be used to break things
there's ice sculptures i guess
fair enough
It could be used to heat something really cold
well if it's melting it's cooling something
unless you're in the arctic or a freezer
i mean ice melts just like all the time even if you're not using it right
Is there one that does not
Most uses of ice involve the ice ultimately melting
i literally don't understand the question
I should mention that you can skate on it in other places too
That's pretty useful
Unless you're skating on it in the arctic
I think so
What
wait what does that mean
Does ice have to be melting to do anything

I get excited when theres an opportunity to use a niche word
I feel like the SATs destroyed my brain so that I look for the vocabulary flex even when  it's not the best word
Yeah it wasn't a good choice by me
I always thought ruminating was like reflecting
Recall is better
NVM I scrolled
Ruminate?
Nah Im busting out recall next time
But you'd look so terrible if you used that in daily conversation lol
Omg recall might be it
In math class this would be "recall"
Usually you would say remember when... but what if you know/assume you both remember
But imagine if youre bringing up a funny memory with a friend
It might just be reflecting
So I'm stuck
I feel like a more active remember = reflecting
Idk if Im over complicating this but it felt like a simple action that I wasnt sure how to express
It sorta involves reflecting though
reminisce?
But also without reflecting on it
Like if you wanted to remember a past event but more actively
Whats the word for when you consciously think about a memory

Osmosis Jones

If you say youre partial to something, is the implication that you like it because youre a part of it
Damn of course the 400 was in our lifetime
The calendar spaces leap years to make the average year 365.2425 days long, approximating the 365.2422-day tropical year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun.
i never knew there were additional rules for leap years???
Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.[2]

"A simple burrito is simpler than a simple house"
I like extreme answers
That is also acceptable
what if they only have fronts
It still means a burrito has no front
What does that mean for the burrito
So with this example in mind, I guess a car that can only drive in reverse is a contradiction
both, right
To or of
I dont think it was clear to the government
Yeah that wasn't clear
There was like no way to go to federal court
Ohh so that's the contradiction part
oh so you always lose???
Because your case isnt relevant there
Why would you lose in state ever then?
But its a federal issue
Well you have to get passed state to go to federal
but like you have to go to WF to not have the law get violated against you
Well state courts arent pools
If you drown in pools why would you get to go to winners finals
However this was addressed in the recent landmark decision of Knick v. Township of Scott
That makes sense tho
If the U.S. government takes your property without compensation you have a federal takings clause but until recently you needed to bring your claim to state court before bringing it to a federal court, but losing in state court would bar your claim from federal court
For reference
Give an example of a known contradiction
but trains are designed to go both ways
But with all of the requirements to still be legally called a car
Well a car can go backwards the whole way
so like a hamster ball
What if you designed an omnidirectional spherical car
what about like when a train is going backwards but the whole way
Its also like an explicit gear which helps make it clear when youre reversing if the car has that
If they move the other way its in reverse
yea it's front sides
Primarily
Cars are designed to move one way
Wait is this still relevant to the burrito thing
I dont think the direction people face matter at all
otherwise it's where the car is moving
otherwise it's where most of the ppl inside are facing
like if there's a driver then front is where he's facing
maybe there's a hierarchy of conditions
Have you ever done that before
What message
I can't believe you deleted that message allen
Cars dont even always have drivers
It doesnt matter where the driver is
Well cars have defined fronts
what if the driver was in the back of the car but he was facing towards the rest of the car and it moved in the way he was facing
It depends on the car
Theres no way its dependent on the driver
i think reverse is whatever direction the driver isn't facing
Is a car that can only drive in reverse a contradiction
Only tops, bottoms, and side(s)
I don't believe burritos have fronts
Well in this case a burrito
And cannot be independently defined
So you're in the camp that things only exist relative to other things
Now it has a front and a top
You put it on the table
It has a top
Okay if you hold a burrito
The Statue of Liberty has a clear top but if you have like a dumbbell the sides become relative to your perspective
Of course
Well it depends on the thing
this argument is really about whether things exist independently or relative to oneself
That's what i'm saying
Why is complexity even relevant
I'm pinging
?
You dirty rat
A burrito is less complex than a house
Yes that is correct allen
But houses would have multiple for upgrades and advancements

Burritos wouldnt even be complex enough to deserve their own slot
The real question is which one has the longer tech tree
Don't have to
Which one would be later in the tech tree
Imagine youre playing civilization
Debate it
Debatable
Houses are wayyy more complicated than burritos
Then it would seem more like the front
But if you imagine they required the same amount of effort to rotate
Like youre not respecting the front of a burrito because its easily changed
I'll get the radio
Theyre just harder to rotate
Well houses are more complex
But that doesnt mean it wasnt the front door
You could rotate a house and the front door could become the back door
But not really a "front"
And there would still be a clear "top"
You could rotate this agreed upon symbol for a Mexican wrap

I'm envisioning a roughly cylindrical burrito
Or a more squarish one
also are you envisioning a totally circular burrito
Then this argument is really about whether things exist independently or relative to oneself
Thats what Im saying
You could say that whatever is in front of you is it's front side
There doesn't always *need* to be a front
Why wouldnt the side closer to you be the front
Since it is really rotated at least a few times while eating
There really isn't a "front"
But since burritos are generally agreed upon being eaten from top to bottom
Well in any perspective anything is anything
The top and bottom are defined by your perspective, and in that perspective theres a front side
But there is a top and bottom
A cylinder has no front
If theres no front theres no top
Only top
There is no front
Is the front of a burrito also the top
So a species with a complex spine may not have as much room to be smart
It is probably more of an indication of how much brain power it takes to operate a spine
The thing says the mass of the brain minus the mass of the spinal cord correlates with animal intelligence
Reptiles lowtier
or temperature
imagine if the only stat that mattered was like buoyancy
No, cause the surface of the brain has mental insulation right?
there's folds in ur brain to increase the surface area to fit more brain but that doesn't make sense cause shouldn't it be about volume and not surface area?????
I THINK so? Cause it decreases brain mass
I don't have enough absolute brain for this
oh wait does having a larger spinal cord actually decrease intelligence in the essay
well it's hard to understand because "slightly less massive" is so vague here especially without the context of what that comparison is like for vertebrates with average encephalization quotient
It looks like its theorized that rather than being correlated directly its linked to weight of the brain?
that makes sense I suppose
oh so does having a big spinal cord increase intelligence
wish I could take anything away from this beyond the absolute amount of brain
One explanation could be that as an animal's brain gets larger, the size of the neural cells remains the same, and more nerve cells will cause the brain to increase in size to a lesser degree than the rest of the body. This phenomenon can be described by an equation of the form E = C(S^r), where E and S are brain and body weights, r a constant that depends on animal family (but close to 2/3 in many vertebrates[16]), and C is the cephalization factor.[12] It has been argued that the animal's ecological niche, rather than its evolutionary family, is the main determinant of its encephalization factor C.[16]  In the essay "Bligh's Bounty",[17] Stephen Jay Gould noted that if one looks at vertebrates with very low encephalization quotient, their brains are slightly less massive than their spinal cords. Theoretically, intelligence might correlate with the absolute amount of brain an animal has after subtracting the weight of the spinal cord from the brain. This formula is useless for invertebrates because they do not have spinal cords, or in some cases, central nervous systems.
Like i already got a big head
Lowkey that sounds awesome. But also terrible
hippos have 1/2789
imagine being 1/7 brain
yo small ants have a 1:7 brain:body mass ratio
Nah, i dont think brain correlates to size at all
I dont know anything about bio but like it makes sense to me that bigger animals need bigger / multiple hearts to pump blood better but does having more mass require more brain mass or is that not a thing
If one animal has a way bigger brain than another one, how does that difference manifest
Like
How does brain size scale

Or what if in this universe America only rebelled because of the holidays preexistence, forming a stable festivity loop
With some like Mothers Day you might as well just start Mothers Day on Mothers Day and theres no problem
Although that didnt stop V I suppose

Ricter and simon piss me off too
These axes anger me
What is this
Based on a really biased selection

Getting trucks to honk I feel is phased out
Are trains trucks
Has anyone ever been in a truck?
We need someone who has been in a truck extensively to confirm since the number of potential occurrences they would have experienced would dramatically outweigh that of non truck experiencers
Thats like a movie thing
When the west coast person questions it, it confirms it is not
Was it ever
Like idk if you guys did cause East coast driving, but trying.to get trucks to honk? Is that a thing still

You guys ever think about how hard it is to know whether something faded away or you just aged out of the situations in which you would see it
Nah on average its the same
Again i dont think it would change, but if i had to choose i think id split. I think straight guys and gay females would on average be stronger due to societal pressure to "be manly"
yea like would social forces make them stronger on average or weaker
I guess you COULD make arguments for sociological effects on working out and strength but i dont think that on average there would be a measurable difference
Uh, on average it should make no difference. If only because of the fact that there isn't anything different other than sexuality (inherently)
do you think the average gay person is stronger or weaker than the average straight person
We have not ever expanded brain

I'd buy sex in league

I retract my statement
Actually theres been times Ive bought skins in league that was better than sex
I think sex is the only thing Id enjoy a transaction for
I mean if sex cost $2 each time I'd still do it lol
Not trying to shame people but I can't imagine enjoying sexual intercourse when it's part of a transaction
Tbh probably sex
But what's something you'd want/do only if it was free
Like most people would be down for most things if they're free
But i wouldn't do it otherwise
And i would so be down to do it if it was free
I saw this detective pikachu draw-your-own icing cookie for like $3
What's something that is only worth it if it's free
You're right in that it's clickbaity but it's definitely more justified than a lot of clickbait
To be fair characters have more legitimate purposes to fill than burgers so its not really a good comparison on my part actually but my issue is more with how hard it is to gauge or debate whether the purpose was fulfilled
But most likely if you say the burger didnt work its both inaccurate and vaguely pretentious
Like, it could be an objectively bad burger but I would still question the phrasing unless it structurally was not a burger
Or imagine if someone ate a burger and said it didnt work
Why twist villains should be held to higher standards
Whats holding twist villains back
How villains could be improved
Well you could have something like why some villains worked better than others or even the problem with these villains and I feel like thatd be more accurate but still engaging
It is simplifying the argument but it makes sense for a title
/ stronger
He explains why some of the villains are better than others
If they did work the title shouldnt be about why they didnt work
A light works because if it doesnt its not emitting light
They evidently did "work" but they could be stronger
This is the issue with saying something creative works or not
Because whats the tangible difference in whether they work or not other than that he would approve
Fair enough to the point, but it sounds like the title isnt accurate then because its like hes saying they did work and that they shouldnt?
which is why they "dont work"
and having weaker villains should be less acceptable
his overall point is that the movies are good and we should hold them to higher standards
but watch it later
i definitely explained that wrong lol
but "dont work" was just a concise way to put it
but he explains it and goes into depth
his argument is that they dont
well he has a lot of reasons explaining why they dont work
It's tough out there
I mean the people need clicks
The thesis would be his actual reason why
Theres no way the title could be his thesis
but then it wouldnt be universally understandable
Im sure the video could be sound but you could title the Declaration of Independence Why British Government Doesnt Work and it would be clickbaity
Is the chat picture click bait
it was just the most concise word for a title
And separate from that I dislike when people use work when talking about storytelling because its almost always the wrong word
yeah the title is just his thesis
If this is clickbait then literally the only thing on the internet that isnt clickbait is Google Scholar
Lisa: the painful rpg got some good villains tbh
I mean I find a lot of titles to be obnoxious clickbait but this isn't even close to one of them
I think the title is obnoxious but getting mad at that is like getting mad at product packaging
I think Thanos was as good as they could have made him given the source material
But who is the hero
Okay well this is really a two pronged issue or three pronged if you include thanos
chris is the best villain
He acts like people dont repopulate
Nah thanos wasnt good
Im on data
but its true
that sounds clickbaity loool
i was actually surprised at how many disney/pixar movies have twist villains
watch the video at double speed
It works
They should be clickbait if they want to be clicked
Should they be as dry and divorced from emotion as possible to not be clickbait?
Like should critiquing videos be titled like an academic study???
every title is clickbait to a certain degree. You want people to want to click your video based on the title
what would you title the video
Im critiquing his title
Like I hate how you can't say something's shit without someone telling you WELL THATS JUST LIKE YOUR OPINION MAN
he just critiques them
he doesnt trash the movies in the video
I mean look art is subjective but if you can't have strong opinions about "good" or "bad" about art you're reducing art to something worthless
watch the video and see what you would title it
a synoptic title doesnt necessarily mean clickbait
But this type of title just draws people in because they agree or get mad
If you wanna talk about what makes a compelling or believable villain, sure
he goes into that!
The idea of working is just too vague and binary
You're gonna want to have the villian be sympathetic and interesting
#Thanoswasright
For that second reason
Thanos is a good villian
Autocorrect
Notice is supposed to be motive lmao
Villains need to either do well at one of two things:   1. Being the most extra villain possible (Dio)  2. Having a good enough notice that you can see how they see themselves as a hero (can't remember an example off the top of my head)
i want to want to be the villain
also to be cool af
although it is getting oversaturated
and to clash well with the hero
to have justifiable motives imo
What does it mean for a villain to work
idk his arguments are pretty solid
There isnt a good non-clickbait outcome of this title
this video isnt clickbait lol
Why clickbait works

Perry Bible Fellowship is an amazing comic
The way her doll is dropped on the floor makes me so sad

I'm not worthy of the waifu
god stands are so cool
still though.... i'm taking the stand arrow
i should mention that not everyone can handle the stand arrow. if you're not "worthy" of the alien virus that awakens Stands, you die a horrible death
definitely the first one
Someone getting possibly reality breaking super powers, or a fictional girl being brought to life
What would have more dire consequences in society

I wanna say thats some naruto shit, but I feel its been long enough that it would be appropriate to say boruto shit
It's too messy
i really want to do the thing where you squeeze your blood into the mosquito and then they explode
Superman
It'd be like eating extra fine seaweed and shrimp
Imagine that texture
Daaaamn
Yes
Would you eat a large bowl of mosquitoes in order for mosquitoes to go extinct
They only alert you so they can juke you
Well if they alert you then you can kill them
Leave
Take my blood
I dont want a heads up
They at least have the courtesy to give you a heads up lol
It only bothers me if Im trying to sleep
the scariest noises
it's one of the scariest feelings
At least they're loud
It legitimately makes me thrash with bestial rage
Hearing a mosquito in my ear makes me angrier than anything else
what about birds and bats
apparently males can bite plants and fruits but females can also do that
Okay I think she should be like Rogue and Spider-Man
*that
only females bite animals
Yo who the fuck decided that of all the animals chat could fly, insects get to
i mean it's called biting
Is it even biting tho
Females are much larger tho
They both bite
female
Which gender is the one that bites
I think they should have a straw
Stan lee was literally trolling when he made spiderman
Lets get to it
It just hasn't been done yet
No
The Mosquito
Theyre neutral enough that you can name a superhero after them
Wasps are fine
Or straight up humans
What about wasps
Mosquitoes are the villains of earth
That would probably hurt more 
yo mosquito proboscises are mad complicated. they're actually made up of six (6!!) different needles
I wish they had nonsharp straws
Yeah nothing eats mosquitoes
extinct
dude i really wish mosquitos were extint
Blood if youre a mosquito
yo cicis
Those jello-y pouch drinks in supermarkets
Also a lot of drinks you get from juice places especially in Asia
2 are hi-c and like treetop Apple juice
i get it
hi c
apple and eve
ahhh tru
is it like 12 types of boxed juice like juicy juice
Early decision them
wait list them
I could think of like 12
You guys need to up your drink game
ikr i couldn't think of a single other drink you have to poke through besides boba
im not a kid anymore :( i didnt even think about capri suns
oh tru
Like Capri sun and koolaid
Well any drinks where you have to poke through something
i think boba straws are like the only ones with sharp end right
boba??
Or maybe I got stronger because in the past I definitely poked with the wrong end before
Which makes my drinking ability inferior to when I was like 7
Negligence
It bothers me because Im pretty sure this is the first time this has happened to me
Amen brother
Whatever side Im on is the sucking side
Is the side you suck from called the flat side, regular side, drinking side, or sucking side
yea like if you submerge the flat side and drink from the sharp side then you're drinking from the wrong side
Isn't the sharp side supposed to be the submerged side
i forgot about the existence of sharp side straws

Actually I guess thats just a snorkel
That would be hype though
Well I mean the sharp side, not the submerged side lol
wait how
Omg Ive been drinking from the wrong end of my straw for 4 hours
tru
Wym its def more an outside America sport
americans need to feel justified in sucking off guns for leisure
like how is it even a sport
clay pigeon or skeet shooting or whatever it is sounds like the whitest sport
Most top level walkers are Russian or Chinese
olympic walking sounds like the whitest sport of all time
which is why olympic walking looks dumb af
also yea walking is about form not speed
it could be in our future
what if you had prosthetic legs and became like iida in mha
I guess it's a cross that bridge when they come to it sort of thing
But theoretically there must be some speed at which the law would take issue
I guess the limit wouldnt even apply if youre on the sidewalk
So as a baseline its not illegal to run faster than the driving speed limit right
that's where stuff gets wild
now some kind of giant humanoid with long-ass legs
i feel like it's impossible for a human to reach a speed walking where we're just like "no you can't do that"
Ohhhhh lol
Also to rephrase my question I meant like what speed would it be illegal for a human to naturally move at in public
Wouldn't your speed demand a change in form
I think its like 5 min per mile
Well whether youre jogging is more dependent on your form than your speed
Whats the Olympic record
I think after that you're jogging at least
Probably somewhere around 4-5 mph
Whats the walking speed limit
lets goo

i found the video about the problems with avocado being marketed as a trendy superfood. it's insane how much water avocados need
Shoot your goo my dude
But can you do it
i feel like if we ever need to use the term "Let's Goo" extended i'd have so many questions to ask before getting to how you extend Goo
It didnt work on me
Nah that would never work
gooooooohhhhhhhhh
But how would you do that with lets goo
Because lets go you can just go like lets gooooooo
Like talking about goo
How would you extend lets goo
Even though it stresses the environment to produce the food at certain times of year
So they just buy the same foods every time of the year
Yeah no one thinks about what foods are is season
so like i wonder about stuff like that constantly
i saw a video online about how avocados being a popular food is actually fucking people up mad hard because avocados require an ABSURD amount of watering
Prob a office job
Could you imagine where Kale would be if it weren't touted as a superfood
I do too
depends what you consider working out. if i made the hottest mixtape of all time but got an addiction to pcp i'd consider that a net loss
On my way!
Come to McDonalds
Was there ever a time that worked out
You know those cases when artists site drugs for their inspiration
Buy yogurt and yoge buygurt
Thats mad funny
Yall ever see that peter grithin meme

Now I cant unsee it
Your gross for saying that

Woah
Go back to 2010
We bake cookies and cook bacon
You ever realize that we park in driveways and drive in parkways
Okay back to brain expansion
We ighttttt
allen says ok
Yeah
do u want me to ask for you
Im sad
But he hasnt checked this
Ima walk to Allens because that feels natural






It's a honda

actual footage of chris topping

Why are you drunk and alone and miles from home
Who cares what you'd like
I dont think Id like that lol
Winner bottoms chris
Just skip to the topping
Wow i can't believe this was just an elaborate scheme to get invited to housla
Also what does loser tops meean
Wait I dont have my switch
@Allen Wu
Omw
LOSER TOPS 
LOOOOL
come over and race allen in odyssey and loser tops
Once we figure that out i think everything else will figure itself out
Win over some drunk girls by perfecting SF2 shirtless
Im not 21
Go to Barcade
Hehe
Why are you drunk, alone, and in Manhattan

Because Im around no one
Why are you bored if you're in Manhattan
Get creative
I would get arrested
Im in Manhattan
Jerk ur ween
Why are you drunk
Expand
And have nothing to do
Guys Im so drunk
It should be like the 4th most common emotion to express at worst
It upsets me how far I have to scroll for surprised emojis

Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Barry Tessler to Professor Sequoia .
i'm almost positive i didn't come up with that observation
Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Barry Tessler to Professor Sequoia .
Omg someone give Barry an award
well duh, that's why he's called Father Time
Also time is relative
my bad
Its a joke
i don't know anything about christianity but i thought jesus didn't literally die for all our sins at all points in time, but died for "our" sins as in the sins of humanity at the time he was alive? idk

Primate city
Or are we driving and they just happened to run into the street
Is this an accident we could have prevented
Like if I killed Stephen hawking though I would just be the guy that pushed back humanities progress for 20 years
Justifiable
Or like bill Cosby
Imagine your kids asking you about trump 30 years from now and you just say oh yeah I killed that guy and got away with it
I feel like if i was constantly reminded i would be less guilty like "yeah i fucked up but you're a huge ass dick for posting on a generic tweet 3 years back about it."
Famous people already made it so I would only feel bad from the moral guilt of killing and not the added guilt
I feel a lot of guilt with murder comes with missed potential
I would feel more guilt cause the world would constantly be reminding me
oh yea accidental
Like if I kill Steven hawking I would feel so much worse than cardi b
I assumed we were talking big famous. Like beyonce
Depends what type of famous tbh
If they're famous I'd get a lot of hate for the rest of my life
Oh if it's accidental that's a whole nother story
Suppose it was a car accident
If the reason is justifiable it's good
If i think someone deserves to die enough for me to want to kill them, i'm feeling however much guilt i'm feeling regardless of their fame
Wait what
i feel like it's cause you can put yourself in the shoes of a random you killed but not a famous person
I think id feel less guilt cause i know the impact of that. If i killed john doe, idk if someone was proposing or waiting for them, and noone isnthere tonsupport their survivors
I would feel the same guilt
If the person famous or not killed my daughter
You didn't ask a question
You still didnt give an answer though
Yeah but my reason
The only difference is one is famous and one is not
All else is held constant between the two murders
But as long as i feel justified
True
Good is subjective
Do i have a good reason for killing them
I have a 5 paragraph essay on why
Yes
do you think you would feel less guilt if you killed a famous person compared to killing a random person
wait i'm so mad i can't find it but i saw a junji ito meme a while back with the girl from uzumaki and a pasta spiralizer and it said "spiral eyes spiralize spiral lies"

Found something that gave me +5 to agility yesterday:
Real eyes realize real lies

It means you're always grinding to get better
If i hear this in my head 24/7 does that mean my soul is dead  https://youtube.com/watch?v=R_uv35rKyFY
Barring the fact that you hear it for most the game I feel like the tone really dictates how a fight feels
Youre the best around the song??!!
The reason I asked people about their favorite JRPG battle theme was because I feel like for regular ol people the theme matters so much
Youre the Best Around gives you +5 to all stats
Rising Fighting Spirit from Naruto
Bardock theme
Metal Gear Rising OST
https://youtu.be/S4E83RKavUU
Work out songs
That song gotta be incredible
And let you withstand the pain / ignore it better
Well the song could basically just boost your willpower
How does a some accomplish that
Like besides putting on actual armor or like a coat?
But how does Blizzard do less damage
I can understand getting someone motivated
How do you increase defense fr
That's almost status inflicting
Lullabies
Ooh music that reduces stats
Hip hop music or lofi hip hop could help with special attack cause they're about like flow and focus
That song traumatized me lol
Sonic drowning theme
At least 5
Jump up super star
Pacific rim is good def though
No like one song for speed/res
Probably like meditation music for res
Pacific rim theme for def
Racing music/break beats for speed
Which song rallies speed and res
A good leader brings out the best in their followers
But then i thought about how blasting good music makes you exercise better or otherwise get more determined/motivated and now i think it's great
I never understood the concept of a "rally" ability to buff your units
omg powering stuff with emotional power
Sound carries a lot of emotional power tho
Salt on top of a speaker

But the vibrations that soundwaves cause transfer enough energy to move things
Cause the amount of energy needed to create the sound would be greater than the amount of energy the sound carried
It would be very inefficient
Can sound power stuff
Are they just coding
Wait what are they about
Omg hackathons arent about hacking

Its 1/4 of professionals for America overall
1/3 of people working in Iowa have a job that requires a license
Agreed. I also personally think we should have a license which must be renewed biannually requiring mental health checks and such
Like a safety knowledge and procedure test
Agreed
To get a gun
I think people should have to pass a test
Also, like dont get me wrong, guns are really interesting and ive shot them, they're fun. But the fact that i could buy an AR before i could buy rum is a huge issue
Which is a step in the right direction imo
I appreciate that too
Like Washington has laws that if your gun is stolen and you dont tell anyone you get charged for the murder it commits
Facts. I really appreciate liability laws tho
Idk how long until it hits close to home
Every other week theres another shooting
It makes me not want to live in the us
Broadswords and dropped ice cream
I personally hate the "gun laws are outdated" argument. Rather i think a lack of ANY gun laws, despite relative fire rate, is just a public safety hazards
And I feel that can be troubling on a primal level
Guns are unfair
Id argue a knife could be more dangerous than a sword tbh
Gun laws were made for bolt action rifles
Like u can run away from a guy with a sword
I think to me its the ease of using a gun and the amount of people it can evaporate in mere seconds
To me, the more important aspect is the ease. You dont have to think about it, its point and click. So the "cowardlyness" of it is just an aspect that makes it easier as you dont get covered in the blood of the person you murdered
And that doesnt feel rational
Like I wouldnt try to rank what methods of murder are more or less bad but the concept of mass shootings naturally makes me angrier than if someone went out and killed people with a broadsword
I wonder to what extent the potential for more cowardly / dishonorable killing contributes to the reprehensibility of gun violence

Ok Clui i laughed way too hard at that
Shoot
On the topic of guns


I wonder how much WeWork costs
But i have a hard time pointing that to controlling bodies as opposed to, the way that babies are made is because men and women bodies are fundamentally different
And unfortunately the extent to which it goes for a man vs a woman is not equitable
I think birthcontrol still needs funding and to be widespread and available
So quite honestly. In a moral sense i cant find means to justify it unless the woman will die in childbirth or rape
Bad people will still get guns even if illegal
But when i observed that argument for myself. I realized that people use that same argument as a defense against stricter gun laws
Actually for the longest time Ive thought of abortion as rather abominable. And supported the laws in place because i felt that otherwise they would still get an illegal procedure and possibly injure themselves or worse 
I guess it all falls under the broader ethical question of selective abortion in general, like when you know a child will have some defect or disease
I dont think it would be unethical
Like, what if a couple wanted to abort their child because they found out the child would have green eyes
I kinda question whether there should be wrong or bad reasons to abort at all
What do you think?
Is it morally wrong
Whats the consensus on sex-selective abortion
So you see why people sympathize with pro life
How somber
The first day of the procedure is selecting which fetus to get rid of
https://youtu.be/dX9Lo20Eb1g
Oh its a thing
Is that a thing
Wait do people ever abort one twin
Wikipedia says in the past Inuit people sometimes killed one twin if twins were born
But with abortions its a little more concrete
But like conservatives still are against masturbating and premarital sex and all that
All these rules were also written before scientific discovery of how this worked
Masturbation isnt a life problem though
Masturbating is banned too
I dont really understand because then masturbation should presumably constitute the same degree of killing as having sex with a condom, but it isnt treated the same way. But I guess its also dramatically less feasible to legislate against
no sex before marriage
abstinence only
i mean i feel like condoms aren't accepted
You're only supposed to have sex with the intention of children
Or are condoms like accepted
Well very conservatively yeah
Cause they're responsible for the most killing
Is the idea that releasing any sperm that doesnt lead to pregnancy is killing
Which is hypocritical
Its that killing is wrong
or that sex before marriage is horrible?
Well condoms are birth control
either way i feel like the religious argument is that pleasure is bad and evil and birth control encourages sex which is pleasure
meanwhile birth control for guys isn't a thing cause they don't want to experience the same side effects that they think is ok for women lmao
like even birth control is that
they're only about control over women's bodies
i'm anti life
Their argument is literally pro life
It is
can we actually have civil war 2 and we'll either have rights or all be dead and both of those outcomes are ok
Or death
Well its not about life though right
But then the conservatives kill black people anyway and the kids have horrible lives
christian hell is actually just grindr
"KiLLiNg is BaD!"
probably like birth control encourages having sex and also sex and pleasure in general is satanic or something
The religious argument is bullshit
probably the same religious argument as like puritans sleeping with wood blocks between husband and wife
What is the religious argument against birth control

These two balls are the same color

It gives you what you look up
My computer is presenting me with phallic imagery


Made by the little big planet people too
Also dreams is probably the most galaxy brain game
YEEEAAHH
Doesnt Super Smash Bros Ultimate stage builder look like little big planet
2 and 3
Actually little big planet is the most galaxy brain game
Which one
Let's watch kung fu panda
Chris being good at math is one of the funniest side details
I dont even know if those exist
If its finance then its probably bitcoin options during the big craze last year
Depends on your definition
That might not make it inconsistent though
It has so many holes
One of those
Actuaally not the derivative but the actual function
Going to infinite
Derivative of  1/x^n starting at n=1
Might take calc 3
Might be the most consistent
Iunno
e^x
I know the answer Im good at derivatives
Why the fuck would sonic need a car?!
Sonic team racing
Whats the least consistent derivative
I'll get the radio
That's what this chat is for
Are we expanding
I guess the galaxy expands by just being there
The universe is more the one expanding
Big brain transcending thoughts
I think it's both
Or is it the rate of expansion
Bless you
That's already half the size
You got RIT and Brown
living in ri is definitely a sad react
LADDER LOOOL
I can't imagine living anywhere non coastal
I think the ladder
Is galaxy brain a reference to the size or level of cosmicality
Sounds like a 
So idk if that's a good or bad thing
I cant
Imagine living in Rhode Island
But people in rhode island are kinda smart
Rhode island brain
Galaxy brain
Contract and contrast
Theyre shrinking to Rhode Island size
Oh like a rock
Our brains are expanding to rhode island size
Fug
well it could be identified
Its by nature unidentifiable
Damg ufo was the only thing i could think of that not only can be very inconsistent in size, but we don't technically even know at all haha
 love you too baby boo
I love Andy beyond alikening
Damn I'd aliken the size of that ufo to a rock
Multianalyzing
Imagine a world in which people regularly said aliken and contrast
Iunno
Alikening?
Comparing
Yeah so whats the word for comparing - contrasting
When you're comparing 2 things you're contrasting them too
I wanted a word for just similarities
Differences
Contrasting is a form of comparing
Well I think contrast means looking at the differences, and compare is looking at similarities and distances
The antonym of compare would ought to be NOT finding similarities right
Or the inverse?? Idk
It's like the antithesis of it lol
Falln gave me shit about saying compare isnt the antonym of contrast
You can compare odyssey to odyssey
I wasn't online yesterday but imo I think the exploration is fun at first but after that you aren't gonna find any challenges that make you want to replay the levels
How big isn't odyssey
How big is odyssey
Did we resolve the replayability of odyssey
You wouldnt be wrong
Why not
Actually you really could
You can't say this car is as big as a car
Exactly
But wouldn't you only be able to compare software to software
The answer is software
Okay now that I have your attention
Im a rock
Is Rhode Island consistently sized
it's part of a rock
Is Rhode island a rock
But if you say something is as big as a rock no one would think to use those as your scale
But if someone said its as big of a rock you wouldnt be confused
yea but they're rocks
S
Aren't planet sized rocks just planet
Nobody calls those rocks
but there's like dust sized rocks and planet sized rocks
People say things are rock sized
They got size 95,000
Rocks are pretty consistent too
You never been to Marshalls bro
as big as a water
Nah shoes are pretty consistent
"This thing is as big as a rock"
A shoe
rocks
Like, what would be the worst thing to use for scale
my ego
rocks
How big is that
Like if I say I'm eating chicken
Cooked meat
What thing has the most inconsistent size
4/4ths ass
Thats literally trash lol
And it's 3/4ths tea lol
I was wondering why this was so diluted

Keepers couldnt use it to block unless they were that far ahead
Nah cause objects pass through you
Soccer might be ruined
it'd be balanced in basketball cause you can't dunk afterwards due to the lag
But either way you can use them to reach slightly higher places
Well I feel like it would still fuck up your body if you used them like that depending on the amount of physics they ignore
We would never need parachutes
With the same limitations as in smash
How different would the course of human history be if we could directional airdodge
>Anyone from Tanya the Evil in anything but Evil (and not just because evil's in the name, because they're literally nazi soldiers)  uwotm8.txt
That was a good pun Allen
I thought you were supposed to do that
People who wipe off treadmills after they run go the extra mile
Or in plot terms I should say
Or not even hard, I just dont do it and that feels weird to think about
Ive always had a really hard time thinking in story terms
Happy birthday
Which excites me because it takes me like 2 years to have an idea
Yo I had a story idea recently
I feel like that could be a movie premise
Since neither of them can be mad
If they both back out its a really funny situation though
I guess its also messed up if they dont back out
Omg I was thinking about that too
Or like is unsuccessful
Isnt it messed up when one person backs out of a suicide pact
Actually thats really hard to do at the exact same time
We both dying
So if the situation is reserved its best if you can move foreword
If youre dying early instead of your spouse what you want is for your spouse to not just be the one whos alive but to be happy
Whichever person survives should ideally be able to move on or else both might as well have died
Ultimately its like what captain America said
i'd much rather be the dead one
Although its pretty different if youre like dying of old age vs in a concentration camp
Well the point is if you would rather be the dead one that might be what your spouse would think too
Although i wouldn't mind being dead as most people lol
If I found someone i wanted to be my wife, I think I'd much rather they be alive and sad than dead
And it was helpful to him
And someone else told him to understand that if it had been the other way around then she would be the one carrying that burden
And he told me about a book about what holocaust survivors went through where there was a guy who was really depressed that he lived and his wife didnt
Is Falln as wise as you
I talked to Falln about the question of whether you would want to outlive your spouse
The true reward
And if that was how I felt, I wouldnt stop
I feel like if I cant be late, I would have a pretty good reason
Or it's a really important event for the company
Nah like, you have a record of being late say
Jobs are fleeting, life is sacred etc
Yeah exactly
that sounds like a company i'd want to get fired from
Even if you were going to get fired for sure?
Yeah Im helping Old McFallnold
Im old
The crowd is old, the person on the tracks is old, hell the train conductor is old
Def help the old person
They all are
Are they old
You cant be late but theres a crowd and one person on the tracks
"You're coming with me!"
Catch the old person and then Help the train

Or beak bird
Like dinosaur
Thats maybe a good reason to replay
What if u want to play certain captures again
Basically my runs
Christian sent an attachment.
The meat moon
Chaotic moral
@Yaseen Mohamed ^^ the pic
I guess if you really want to fight broodles without moon physics

Which story moons?
Since you cant just go back to them in your file
You need to replay if you really enjoy getting the story moons
Wait I thought of a reason
But why wouldnt you just do that in your first run
e
like after a first casual playthrough of the run you could get different moons the second tim
I mean its a somewhat disingenuous statement to make about games that are hard to 100%
is this like replay value after you've 100%ed it
Yeah so I cant really think of any reason to replay it
Speedrunning doesnt count
@Yaseen Mohamed I cant stop thinking about whether Odyssey has replay value
FUCK LOL
Materialize in front of me captain
Actually thats just pokemon
Idea for a horror game where characters materialize and seems like the game is bugged but is intentional
It was pretty creepy and I thought it was intentional but I found out later it was a bug
One time I was playing New Vegas and near the beginning when I went to leave the house the robot npc materialized in the doorway and was just there
Why do you go crazy and why are there mutants in it
What is the annihilation zone
Art is subjective
What if i LIKE when i clip into the wall during a story moment
Lets go
Wait I got more likes
@Chris check WhatsApp
It is functionally better
But thats actually how I prefer it
That one is actually a perfect instance of an opinion generated to make someone mad
I went as far to take a picture
Im mad more people didnt complain about the toilet roll thing
How'd you know
That sounds like something someone with a pb above 2 hours would say
Its the genius in the tweet
Fad* diets
Allen I walked in the same mentality then he said dad diets were bullshit and Odyssey has no replay value and I was EMBARRASSED
That city trial is ass
Or be told
Some people have to know
Mad opinions lol
Didn't know what else to call em haha
I said opinions that would make someone angry
I dont know much about most of the things he tweeted about but the Chad energy made me reflexively disagree
I didnt say unpopular opinion lol
I don't have much else to say about that though lol just thought I'd mention
Speaking of Chris I've actually agreed with most of his unpopular opinion tweets
Yo I thought Chris said all of that at first and was shook
The thought I mean
It's innately sad but it can only be as prevalent as you let it be
I think a lot of what we do and how we're told to think is in an attempt to minimize thoughts about how we all inevitably fall
Which sounds and is sad but there can be more to it than that
It just felt like a clear manifestation of how life moves toward decay
And to a lesser extent a lot older relatives are always getting generally weaker
But this time she wasnt even conscious and just looked like she was in a constant nightmare
The last time I saw her like 4 years ago she didnt recognize me or anyone and I kind of thought that was as bad as her condition would get
I saw my grandma in an elder care facility a few days ago
Like theyre both pretty negative concepts but the result seems to be an evolving world that is more or less stable
And they balance each other in a weird way
So much of Annihilation was about cancer, but thats almost the opposite of annihilation
It could be cancer I guess
So theres something in that equation that I want to think about more
But despite the fact that everything is always decaying over time, life quality doesnt go strictly downhill
It makes me so sad to see my relatives getting older and frailer over time
It seems like an important idea to think about especially as you transition into adulthood and you see people and relationships in your life transforming and breaking apart
I worded that wrong
Like if anything its acknowledging that nothing in life is permanent so you need to make the most of things or something radically new will replace you
It approaches impermanence in a way that doesnt amount to nothing matters so why bother
Even in the trailer line when she says the thing isnt destroying, its creating something new
I def agree
I feel like in some ways Annihilation explores that
Its hard to express the idea without coming across as nihilistic but if you theoretically remove instinctive resistance to impermanence it doesnt have to sound depressing or negative
But what isnt objective is the negative connotation the idea has
Or decaying
Not necessarily as an action but I guess everything is in a constant state of falling apart at various rates
Or things in life
Like the movie falls apart
Watcha mean
I think that objectively, everything falls apart
Its a movie that I liked more when I read theory about it
I really like annihilation
SO GOOD
I watched it yesterday and Ive been thinking about it but its hard to articulate
Annihilation
Has anyone seen Annihalation
Yeah. With that we could say the game is art because of the grooves on the disk
Which is maybe what youre saying
Although I wouldnt say game design as a whole is an art
Like you can literally dump trash out of a dumpster onto the ground and give it some measure of artistic merit, and given that it seems hard to say that a game cant be art
But in games it just doesnt work
Its too broad of a concept, to the point where total rejection of art is also art
And it most art there is such contrast
Yes. Art would not need the meshing of these concepts. The contrast between those two things would actually be an artistic message if it didnt affect quality
I feel like if theres some combination of human input and intentionality a thing can probably constitute art
I keep distancing myself from work
Ack my head hurts
But that isnt a formula thats just a statement that like, consistency between mechanics and metaphor are usually a good thing
Ok
But the gameplay doesnt change because its about how you refuse to improve or change yourself despite the world changing around you
Then it already fits the story. And if you changed/ gained power ups then it would be worse
So events are changing in the game
But what if the game was about your stagnation as a person
I know Allen
I mean it <could> make a better game
I commissioned art today
But if it was fitted to the story, you change as events change, it would make for a better game
There is nothing wrong with that objectively
The gameplay stays constant throughout the entire game
Okay a better example
Hierarchy of info Im looking at
Sense of place
The visual cohesion of the scene is broken
I guess the clipping would also be breaking the story actually
Its breaking everything
The coffee cup is more breaking the story
In the same way that if I stop my digital game character from clipping through a wall that from there I can create a better game using very specific metrics
Nor would I be able to definitively tell you how to make that episode perfect
If the coffee cup wasnt there I wouldnt suddenly have a perfect experience
If I see a coffee cup during a game of thrones episode Im a little bit thrown out of the experience
Thats what I dont understand about this distinction
Right but there are SO many things that can worsen your experience in other art
If Im clipping through a wall during an important story moment then that would worsen my experience
But that wouldnt make them perfect
Like I think there are flaws to games and ways to improve upon them
Or sculpture
Or film
For the same way that I wouldnt feel similarly about painting
Yeah I still dont agree that theres a right way to make games
You can not do whatever you want in game making and not affect the quality
There is a way to make games right
Games are not art, they are a craft
LA Noire explodes
Oh well lol
The window and door were in front of me
Yeah I looked straight ahead
uh they stayed straight too
I closes them
Like what direction did your eyes move
Yeah I looked straight
Watcha mean what direction
I didn't turn my head
What direction did you look in?

Done
Imagine a white room with a red door and a blue window
Yeah
Did you read all of harry potter?
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was so good

Pizza?!

Pizza
Damn hell yeah
Right now?
Pizza?
Damn spaghetti is good
Now
It looks so weird how
Yo i just said spaghetti way too much
Spaghetti in smash
Mom's spaghetti
Spaghettios
Uh oh
Imagine a food more associated with mistakes than spaghetti
A real collision of ideals
There is a protagonist and antagonist
This had so much more comedy and narrative than i expected
https://youtu.be/oy6_dKnmvuM
Spaghettios come in a can already in the soup
Not a cereal
It isn't made with milk in mind
Seriously tho have you had spaghettios
It's a metal vehicle with wheels
If it has an engine
Is a bike a car
and wheat is a cereal grain
well spaghettios are actually the same shape as many common cereals though
Chris is a lawyer
I rest my case
Or any pasta is cereal
Spaghetti Os
That's like saying mac and cheese is cereal
Have you ever had them?
are spaghettios cereal
They have spaceships
Where does the pegasus come from
when are captain marvel and valkyrie getting together
Mvc End
is he gonna have a sword in mvc4
wait when
Didnt they say Hawkeye was going to Japan next
or made it even funnier??? idk
like that ruined the scene
i could tell whoever was under the mask was white cause his japanese was bad lmao
Hulk discovered rumble balls
Only a true weeb would say that
Hulk got hybrid point
My man said shinei
That's pretty good
In 5 years Hawkeye became a weeb
Actually wait
If you're gonna skip time, make it important goddamnit
And they become CONSIDERABLY more powerful
Most shonen characters only skip like 2 years at most
no new memes developed in 5 years
That's a good example of dramatic time skip
Captain America was frozen for 50 years and is STILL dealing with it
Its just so lazy
5 whole times
chris turn your gaydar up
That means that in like 5 times of human history, not a single new development was made
yea he said he went on a date with a guy
besides someone literally saying 5 years passed
Wait I was not paying attention during that scene was the guy gay?
If anyone knows anything about warcraft, illidan was imprisoned for 10,000 years
literally the only references to the fact 5 years passed i think???
and there was a grieving session with cap and a gay guy
except antmans kid was large
Fortnite got snapped
like there was literally no way in which 5 years was relevant
Or fortnite never develops a new season
Wait thats the biggest plot hole
It makes me so angry that they wrote 5 years just for dramatic effect
Maybe everyone is just owned by hydra still. You cut off one head two more show up type of bull but itll be one head since the other was snapped
Literally they were so thoughtless about making it 5 years that fortnite was still in season 6
or like the food chain
ikr like how did capitalism not collapse
With Tony stark alive
Im guessing most of the important people didnt get snapped
5 years is a LONG time
How were there no developments at all
But Allen wouldnt get snapped
like it should've collapsed
And was literally just so that Tony's daughter could count to 3000
civilization held up kinda good 5 years later
I think Im still younger than Allen
5 years was dumb
Thats so weird that most of us would just be older
I already got 3 people to agree
Wait would I be the same age as Thao if she got snapped
At a time and way of your choosing
Thao can i kill you
i'm definitely tryna get snapped
For vision and bwidow
Add a third number
who doesn't want to be snapped tho
Lets see who didnt age 5 years
Like take out the evens
Then the Hulk snap brings em back 
*random list generator*
Don't just say it and then never refer to the consequences
Lets put NSM names into a random number generator and see who gets snapped
When your crushs SO gets snapped
Make it more meaningful
If you're going to make a dramatic amount of time pass
It definitely started mad relationships
Like how lucina is thousands of years after marth
It would have been treated like any other death
yea but the disappearance is like sad but the reappearance is big awk
Yeah
I think most people just held the L at that point
5 years was probably way too long tbh
Not as much as the disappearance
actually reappearing 5 years later would wreck so many relationships lmao
It's funny to think that Spiderman reuniting with his best friend was a morbid indication that his best friend died
Good thing Spider-Mans best pals all died
and schoolkids
It must be so weird for all the young people who became 5 years older than their SOs after endgame
Scroll up lol
Wait who said any of that
Like why would I watch gone with the wind when I can play fortnite for free
I dont think its less disposable income I think it was just more normal to go on the movies back then as it was the main source of entertainment
Cant wait for Peacemonger
The first villain in iron man was the ironmonger
Killmongest
Killmonger 2
how are they gonna top killmonger tho
i'm hype for black panther 2
Mission impossible is an amazing franchise wasted on Tom cruise
Im such an action movie fan
I'm surprised mission impossibles aren't more popular
usually i'm not a fan of action movies but furious 7 was so over the top that it was like a great comedy
Why make movies if youre not gonna do that
And they pulled a bank vault out of a bank with a tow truck
I remember a tank being in one movie
and flexing his biceps in the hospital and his bandages explode
Its just a band of goons with muscles
but there was the rock driving his car into a helicopter
Theyre like American jojos
there was like no cars
I wanna watch 7
i only saw 7 and it was so good
I hear the fast and furious movies are fucking great
Avatar is the worst
Yeah fuck that movie
i hate avatar
Oh no
like he was just a coors light commercial
Avatar to me will always be the why the fuck did this movie obliterate the box office movie
Wait were you not here for my rant on my hatred of avatar
kurt russell dying in furious 7 like "good thing i have health insurance... and a coors light" and then he dies
Maybe Im alone in this
I remember the tree burning in avatar and being like damn I wish I was watching Pocahontas
So she technically dies off screen
Cause she just crashes
also michelle rodriguez was way better in furious 7
omg i didn't even remember she died
All other scenes are unimportant
Michelle Rodriguez dying
Avengers 1 is pretty much just the final battle
the existence of norm in general
norm running out surrounded by navi while he's just a normal guy
Resurrecting the scientist
The tree burning down
Taming a dragon
Becoming a navi for the first time
Besides that it was a "big thing in the sky" movie
and then he stomps the ground and makes an earthquake like what kind of movie is this
The only thing I remember from Avengers 1 was Hulk dumpstering Loki
Woaah if anything avatar is just composed of memorable scenes
and then when he says "the thing about street fights is... the street always wins" like what the fuck is he even saying
"u thought this was gonna be a street fight? u rite"
They fought with mechs at the end that shouldve been the whole movie
Nothing about the characters or moments or dialogue from avatar even remotely registers in my brain
I guess I should have said scenes? Idk
What is Tokyo drift even
like it was a great comedy
whatever furious movie that was was one of the best movies i've ever seen
I had strings but now i'm free there are no strings on me
was furious 7 the one where the rock is like "daddy's gotta work" and then he flexes his biceps and his cast explodes
You want to protect the world but you don't want it to change
I remember some ultron lines
idk any lines from ultron or avengers 1
the only line i remember from avatar is someone saying "jake sooley" in an alien accent
I dont just mean dialogues
Like when I say lines
yea that one
Black Panther: bury me in the ocean like my ancestors...
ancestors*
Lines
my ancestor knew death was better than bondage
The only lines from endgame that are long and memorable are thanos loves
the power of the black panther will now be stripped away
it really was
like the only line in titanic i know is draw me like one of your french girls
What's a line from black panther?
and it was
it was called the ship of dreams
So wait which ones do you want
besides like endgame, black panther, and titanic
Ok
Gimme literally any line from any of those movies
idk any lines from like basically all the movies on this list
Avatar is just really pretty
Nah but like Titantic is memorable dialogue and characters
it was before the time of memes
That isnt more than like 2-3 words long
Uhhh
also the fact that the adjusted for inflation list has stuff like gone with the wind is wild like that means way more purchasing power went to watching movies back then probably??? i feel like really it means the economy now is bad and we don't have the disposable income to use it on movies as much
You cant tell me a single line that came out of that movie
My favorite thing about avatar is
i can't believe titanic made so much money unadjusted for inflation?????
And that's probably all you need
It was like the breath of the wild
I think Avatar was just the first IMAX HD movie of all time and it got mad hype behind it pre release
yo black panther in the top 10 that's hype
or furious 7
Most of them are just reboots of beloved franchises
yea i actually just don't get avatar lmao
They make sense but like
It's probably the most predictable list tho tbh
EXCEPT for avatar
They make a lot of sense
The top 10 movies are so weird
I shouldnt have checked messenger
*math
Nvm chris is good at marth
Holy shit Chris they could totally do that lmaooo
@Chris Colon check messenger
What if they put avatar in the marvel universe
Which would be pretty tasteless
Unless they get rdj back
Maybe untrue
Thats
There probably will never be another marvel movie as successful as endgame

it feels exactly like those videos in movies that explains what happened to humanity in a post apocalyptic world
Its narrated by captain kirk from star trek lol
wait this video is so anime
They really let nerds name all this cool shit lmao
YOOOO
https://youtu.be/vl6jn-DdafM
Like a judas
Like, someone or something that does the opposite of the precedent
predecessor
What's the opposite of a successor
Code Monkeys walked so that TBBT could run
It was part of the movement that normalized geek stuff
The show just synergized REALLY well with it

Though I don't know how much of that is because of the show
That is true
And we live in the age of geek stuff
It's been running for 12 seasons
Don't take that in an accusatory manner I'm legitimately curious
How so
One of the most arguably important pop culture shows ever
It kinda just low key ended
I'm pretty surprised that wasn't a bigger deal
For some reason I thought it legitimately would never stop
No way
*had
Yo big bang theory just has it's series finale
Allen can i get you to rap that
With relative ease
It's all about SANIC
Nah
it's all about xmen quiksilver
mcu quiksilver is so bad
this stone is op
Scarlet witch and quiksilver got their powers from the space stone too btw
black widow is actually like the level 1 bottom tier story character you need to bring to missions
Paralyzing peeps for the sake of story
Civil War Vision was schmooving
But idk if that's the mind stone or just Jarvis
Vision can also shut off your wifi
It was just that the space stone was the only stone on earth at the time to justify it lol
Vision can phase through objects which isn't used nearly enough
that seems so unrelated to her powers
Carol gets her powers from the space stone
i'm so ready for ironheart
he has thors lightning in him
I dont think so
which is reasonable cause isn't he supposed to have all their dnas or something
oh yea and that
He picked up the hammer
i can't remember vision doing one single thing besides flying
Or hit by the worf effect to use the academic term
what does vision even do
like there's no way someone named vers is straight
i'm so shook she was just named vers in her movie
I feel like Vision got powecrept harder than anyone else
wait what stone did captain marvel get her powers from
The pioneers used to ride Vision for miles
Can vision mind control people
and then without it he's a rock
like was he just a smart rock
was vision even smart when he had the mind stone
With relative ease
He can destabilize the core
When I saw ease the first thing I thought of was lanky kong doing some shit with relative ease
Omg
I bet you could destabilize the core with the same amount of ease as demolishing the moon
Because by the piccolo theorem captain marvel can destroy the moon
Depends who you are
How much harder is it to destroy the earth than the moon
Frieza
Nope
Also vegeta could destroy a planet in like the saiyan saga
But Loki did
Yeah but captain marvel didnt move when Thor got his hammer
She destroyed a planet and would have continued
Dark Phoenix is a cosmic entity that possesses Jean grey
Are y'all watching thur video
Is dark Phoenix stronger than captain marvel
*is
Purple us buster and smash
Is purple buster
It gave him the ability to know everything
All I remember is time is green
And it cursed him with knowledge
Can someone explain what each stone does, but in like 2 words each
also soul stone does literally nothing in the movies
Thanos had the mind stone from the beginning
i feel like time stone is crazy op
Thats my favorite
This video brought up an interesting point
Is the answer reality Stone
https://youtu.be/MmeAgtLm_OM
I knew Captain Marvel was the strongest avenger tbh as soon as I saw her s.HK
do you think the mcu will ever have xmen
100%
But if she fought piccolo she would win
Captain marvel never fought any gods
Piccolo
I can only assume that the power imbalance comes from herself
What god
Well how come Captain Marvel got energy from one stone and is like stronger than gods
Power stone is guardians of the galaxy
no the purple one that gives you super punch
That's why that stone was arguably the shittiest
Is that the tesseract one
the power stone had a pretty good 1 second
basically everything involving the soul stone in the movie was crazy made up im pretty sure???
Man dormammu really lost to one stone, and nobody but thanos remembered that individual stones could do anything and were the points of whole movies
yea she's midnight
Midnight is pretty goth
thanos didn't even have a big tiddy goth gf in the movie
Stonesd even
He got stoned in the movie too
autocorrect no
stones* LMAO
except thanos gets stoned
the infinity war saga was like 100% different
Give me Modok
Well it was them adapting existing shit
Didnt like all of infinity war happen
infinity war was like basically just them writing their own shit
There's no one stopping them
They should do mvc
They own themselves
i'm ready for the modok dlc
Is that allowed
I wonder if they'll ever start just writing their own shit
They succeeded
That's what they want you to think
Galactus will be the next big arc
So that they can write about them later
or antman being smaller than one dust
if you get snapped but your being is not physical and it's just super being like dormammu do you not turn to dust
They're definitely leaving it purposely ambiguous so that threats like galactus and the celestials aren't mentioned
Survived the coin flip
When in reality he couldve just like
I dodged the snap
Yeah you can get snapped if youre a god but it seems like dormammu could be beyond the snap range
Wait yeah Scott was like
And it's shown that like, "gods" don't actually matter
Well never know
Well also was Antman snappable
Those were my two thoughts on this
Much less the whole gauntlet
He couldn't even deal with just the time stone
Dormammu is 100% snappable
Hes in a different realm isnt he
Is Dormammu snappable
But will it beat gone with the wind
Like it can't not at this point
Nah it will lol
yea i sure hope so
Well its about to
Like just cause it existed doesn't mean they didn't have to work for it
But they had to make hype beyond just comic book  followers
that's true although you'd think that'd lead it to make more money than avatar
I mean marvel has built up for decades
How so
and then iw alley-ooped it to endgame
yea it was more like infinity wars cultural impact
Well most of endgames cultural impact already existed
But that's not a bad thing, it's just a movie that makes no sense to be #1 grossing
also avatar probably made more money per ticket cause it was like super imax 5d vr magic tickets
Avatar has literally 0 cultural impact
although maybe avatar was more international??? idk
endgame is such a widespread cultural phenomenon and avatar was so not
Like, whaaaat did this motherfucker see in the Mariana trench
And the third highest
You would never think this director made the highest grossing movie
Like no joke this is such a chaotic image
James Cameron is wilin

the world building and graphics was the point of the movie i guess but the actual plot was unbelievably bad
super cliche white savior movie like actually just why
omg i agree i hate avatar
And abandoned the dragon he imprinted on
And Jake sully got the special dragon
With dragons
There were floating mountains
All I really remember at this point is that there were cool mountains
The monkey's beat the mechs
"Unobtainium"
There's absolutely nothing special about it
See I feel like the majority of peoples complaints about it are that it was successful
But this one off sci fi pocahontas really doesn't deserve to make as much money as it does
I like high budgets
I liked avatar
And retribution
The avatar series deserves recognition
Not only is it uninspired and overrated, but it made it so there can never be an actually good avatar last airbender movie
God i hate avatar
They waited for avatar to get dethroned
I wonder if he's ever even seen an anime series
Avatar 2 is coming out in 2021 though
Who decided james Cameron was so good
Its reign is nearly at an end
What an undeserved achievement
I absolutely HATE that avatar is so high
What a statement
And Endgame is about to overtake the sound of music
The top 5 are gone with the wind, avatar, titanic, Star Wars and the sound of music
1.2 billion more to beat Gone with the wind for highest inflation adjusted gross
Omw
It needs 2 million more to pass avatar for highest grossing of all time
Its interesting following how Endgame is doing
Minions is #19
Lol
Although its not inflation adjusted so obviously its mostly recent stuff but #50 is Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix
I think whether or not something intends to be like "high art" or "artistic," if you indulge in an artistic medium like movies it's art anyway
And the list is like incredibly not stacked lol
Because I was looking at the highest grossing movies of all time
I was about to bring up Harry Potter actually
Like people make fun of The Fountainhead/Atlus Shrugged for being terrible books (and they are) but laud Harry Potter when it suffers from many of the same problems
Idk if endgame ever intended to be art
More stuff like Mob Psycho, less stuff like Naruto/One Piece
I think art nowadays needs to be more concise
Also I don't watch super long tv shows often and I dread that experience too
I guess? But it feels like watching a tv show is more manageable than watching a series of movies even if they aren't necessarily that different in terms of sheer time spent
Well you could say that about like the third season of a tv show
let me go back to just needing to watch iron man 1
and it's just like
the backlog of all the different mcu movies i need to see to get the full iw/eg experience is the main thing stopping me from seeing iw/eg
like incomprehensible plots that incorporate 10 billion different superheroes/plotlines
i think honestly the problem with the mcu is that now its trying to do the thing that makes comics shitty (imo).
Did Antman or iron man contribute more to endgame
But they introduce quantum woman and then just throw her away
I liked when he was at the school
It was good tho
I watched antman and the wasp for this
I'm also salty that they don't try to explain the quantum realm at all
Back to the future 4 will fire back
Like, how you gonna make fun of time travel in every movie and then do the exact same thing
But it's all made up for because they got to go back to the other movies
I'm so upset they couldn't write it better
If thats the case then theres going to be an incomprehensible number of thanii, and each iteration only widens the gap between pasts and timelines where hes stopped
So each one of them will create 3 more timelines where thanos needs to be stopped?
they'll just deal with him the same way
That leaves 3 timelines which more or less had their time disturbances fixed, which means they still need to deal with thanos
The plot kills 2 thanoses, which is weird for the gotg timeline since that makes it diverge dramatically, but
So 5 thanoses
And all the other timelines diverged from the present only due to the time travel
The present, the avenger, gotg, the dark world?, and like 1970
Yeah
Okay so disregarding the question of why new timelines arent created when Captain America returns the stones, theres 5 timelines, right
yeah definitely
Is it safe to discuss endgame now
So about thanos



Got some stuff in the works
Ill work on it
How come nothing cooler than Zed ult has come into existence in the last 7 years
The idea of consequence golf is sooo funny lmao




my favorite coding interview to ask ppl is the xkcd blog post about optimal numbers of toilets

i've been reading xkcd for a looong time
i'm just updating yall
nope
andy did u just discover xkcd





sorry i dunno why i posted that in this chat
It That Gets Left Hanging sent an attachment.

I cant wait to watch that video LOL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kotWv4MCxNI
I heard a rumor once that the turkey legs at disney land are actually emu
Australia low key lost a war vs emus
they're menaces
And Emus
they kick the shit out of you and swallow apples whole

They're the deadliest bird on earth iirc
Cassowaries are another big bird that should make you afraid of feathered dinosaurs











yeh me and paul's ancestors woulda been sauteed and fed to the birds
Bless the allies winning cause me and quite a few of us wouldnt be here talking in chat with yall

So is the bedroom
The UN is in NY
Its like the UN all in one room
The bedroom is the most hierarchical location of the house:  You got the Master bedroom, king and queen sized beds, doms and subs
8
on a scale of 1-10 how funny is the sentence: I want to yahoo.
Same Ill fill in my own answer for what went down
the problem is that he answers the question as part of q&a panels and i'm not looking through every con they've been at to find out
In my brain its just always tbd
LOL I think about it daily but never look into it
I still never bothered to look up Arin's explanation of why Girlchan 4 fell through. Even though he's answered that question at least 5 times over the past 5 years or so
Girlchan was ahead of its time
i like how these specifically interrupt the sakuga to show you aqua's butt for a frame. it reminds me of that bit in girlchan in paradise where all kinds of shit is going on and then it cuts to girlchan but she's all boobs (more than normal) and she's just saying "poingpoing"
Konosuba and idk
What are both of these from
Those are some of the first examples that came up when i googled, but i don't necessarily think fire


I just imagine magic circles
That or magic missile
Probably fire
Uhh
Or electricity
I feel like the common fireball is the go to
In a video game context, when a game says "Mage casts a spell!"   What do you see
and the highest damage
Lmao with no context or scale 1300 damage is definitely the most arbitrarily funny number
*Barney casted a fire spell*  *1300 Damage*
like 50/50 green and purple
I was offered to do it but I'm scared of a bad trip
Wait is it green fire or purple
it was phenomenal
Remember when u two did acid together
so what's the play
but it also wastes time to say my friend is on fire, which is green
I'd do green fire if it was a drug
I think it would be waxing suspiciously poetic to say my friend is engulfed in green fire
Oh wooord lmao
if you say my friend is on green fire that sounds wrong and also like drugs
Done
okay say you're like calling 911
Stupid guy
Shit..
You will never not be funny to me
Status: on fire will never not be funny to me
"Do i look cool?"
Ur head is one fire... and its a lovely magenta !
Well what color is regular, not-weird fire
if someone is engulfed in green fire that's probably more concerning than more traditionally colored fire
well you could argue that the color is less important than the fact that the person is on fire, but I think for weird colors of fire it's worth mentioning
Yeah status is still: on fire
Cuz the reason youd modify what drugs someone is on is that the treatment and affects are different
Like ur head is on fire
The reason Im asking about the color of the fire is that does the coloration change how it affects you?
I think if u specify someones body part is on fire you can never confuse them regarding whether theyre doing something really well or actually burning
the fire is on the person
also, why does that phrase even exist

Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Yaseen Mohamed to Yaseen the writer.
you can modify when people are on drugs
you should be able to modify the fire that people are on
Holy shit yaseen the writer
Why is the purple part important
She's engulfed in purple fire
"On fire" is definitely its own descriptor
if you wanted to convey that someone was on fire, but the fire was purple, would you say she's on purple fire or do you need to phrase it in a more wordy abut clearer way
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, how could you? Fool me three times, you're officially that guy.
It's only bad when it lies like 3 times in a row
The extra second or so of tension it sometimes adds is so good
It is so hype when it lies
I like how it is
Id prefer red electricity to always work
Thats crazy
Because the prediction is guaranteed to come true
The Stand Thoth in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure predicts the future with 100% accuracy, but the means you're powerless to actually use the information in the vast majority of situations
this is literally a genuine philosophical quandary. is it better to know your future or not?
i never thought about that tbh
would that be better or worse
what if it was never wrong
guys you know the red electricity and freeze frame in smash that shows when you're gonna die but sometimes it lies
he's like s-tier in terms of galaxy brain thoughts
i can't comprehend this chat not having leon on it up till now
if we add leon we gotta talk about a brain expansion thing so he doesnt think this is a pot head chat
honestly doing someone's drugs and dumping them while on it is big dick energy
damn neither tess nor leon is in this chat to be tagged
tess's birthday gift to allen 
coca cola used to have death squads
if it makes you feel better i once gave away a dudes birthday gift to me right in front of him
i'd say thats a win
i definitely think about how i snorted a dudes expensive drugs for free and then dumped him
then they replaced it with caffiene
cocacola used to have cocaine
fuck costco
me
like who wouldn't do a cocaine costco sample
what if it was free for the caviar
i mean i'd do it if the caviar was also free for him
id be like no that's too expensive
like if somebody was like hey wanna do caviar with me, it's free
god i love dan's stories
yeah dan from game grumps said his favorite thing about quitting weed was all the cash he saved
my price isnt comparatively
i feel like i was raised so frugal that it makes me want to not consume too much drugs like that's so expensive
that sounds terrible
im sure there's more than a few methods to ingest
yea but like then it can drip onto the back of your tongue from your nasal passage or whatever
oh wait it dripped from inside the shnoz to the tongue?
i thought cocaine was ingested through the shnozzle
it dripped down onto my tongue and tasted so bad so i was like uhhh no more for me
my stern coworker told me he did coke and that the scariest part was that he really wanted more coke
i did coke with a bad guy i met off tinder and then i dumped him while i was high
whoa thao you did coke? that's hard af
At least not when im going back home haha
after I came home to my mom off the edible im neva doing it again
buy my ediblessssss
after i did cocaine and was underwhelmed now i'm like ok everything is way less scary
Like we have access to los weedies
It's def doable
i only tried it once and nothing happened cause i was kinda scared to do a non trivial amount but now i'm more like ok i want to try
but in Jake's Backyard never one single tweak
barry trust me when i say you won't bug out, if i've ever bugged out it's bc im like at a dorm or can be caught
that was scary and not fun either lol
also ran away from the police the first time
its not for everyone. literally my first 5 times was unpleasant every time
i think the best strat for me is try to not get stuck my head. just enjoy the there and now and everything ends up pretty fun
i wanna try weed but my brain chemistry is fucky so i'm worried about what would happen
i get nervous sometimes
oh dude yeah for sure
part of it bc of my shitty bluetooth earbuds
i think i've only ever enjoyed smoking with people im very comfortable and familiar with. I;ve had afair share of unpleasant experiences too on it
all the music is chopped and screwed
all i know about edibles is that dan from game grumps said you get munchies and eat more edibles and so on
i think my heartbeat went to the negatives after i had one
that me
smoking is psychic and the edible is choice specs doom desire
and thats uncomfortable for some
u can have one and then be on themoon
when u eat it
the only thing is its hard to control how much u intake
what kinda edible
no like rice krispie
wait as it like a weed brownie
i think it takes her like 12 shots to feel a buzz
i think its better than smoking
I listened to fetty wap on the subway and heard extra instruments
Tess is immune to ever substance
is it better than smoking
weed saga
last monthly
I ate an edible for the first time two weeks ago
i wanna try wid
She's pretty immune
Tess got a widdle high once but it wasnt anything major
Also I never really bought weed I just smoked with my friends so idk whats going on until in the couch
$10
Thao I want to hear you absolutely obliterate capitalism while stoned off your shits
when is buying my edibles
i felt like sativa = upper indica = downer
does that depend on strain for u
can i join whatever weed sessions y'all have with tess just once
Box of chocolates
Also sometimes it makes me mellow and sometimes it does the opposite
lol
i think weed is best. its not crazy or make u crazy
Yeah i've only done weed and very few others
hehe
Unpopular i know
Weed GOAT drug
BRUH
you're name is ANDREW
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H4gqPBUT0w&feature=youtu.be
guys what's your favorite drug
ur gonna be in hell for 69000 lifetimes
I'd need to be on the friendlies set up with parecki and fak
if u arent in like a good environment
im scared as heck to take lsd
I'd need super friends
I've wanted to take it as of recent but I'm not in the state of mind for it
or do the walls just swirl a bit
have u lived 6900 lifetimes ?
^^ yeah im actually shook
I'm always on lsd man
is the best thing ever
ye fuck it ill watch
WAIT andy and allen doing lsd together
The caption LOL
https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/eric-cantona-instagram-video-penis-smashing-egg-watch-manchester-united-city-a8884391.html
waaaaaaat
Im with Christian on this one
:o
with andy
actually u dont have to share info u dont want to
Allen did u do it with someone else or alone?
As in, not cruishing it in between 2 things
give me the link
i need the link
uh thao, i'm gonna need video verification on that video
Assuming that you can only use your dick
also i want to do lsd
it was hype
yea i saw a video where a guy had an egg on his stomach and he whipped his dick up and it broke the egg
this sounds like a side event for the next monthly
im sure with an axe kick esque motion performed with one's phallus it can be accomplished
Oh like my dick instead of the counter?
like u just give it a nice whack
like can i use my dick to knock an egg off a table
define "with" in that context thao
also Allen u did LSD whattt
guys can you crack an egg with your dick
she want that gator juice

LOL. im gonna need to find test subject then first
Let's do some tests christian
as in made it sweeter
a girlfriend i dated some years ago told me that gatorade did affect it
apparently pizza makes it taste horrible
Asparagus too
Generally
is pineapple juice a reference to controlling the taste
If only
Being horny is a crime
Sex isnt even real
trans guys are the future of porn
Bald and either black or ambiguously hispanic
3-7 min is "adequate" via study
Is being bald a requirement
Lemme google it and check
Bruh is this like the first time having sex in 10 years statistic lol
Im like pretty sure its super fucking low
2 minutes??
Bruh what
Wrong number my b
Wait, no its 2
I feel like that stat has no value unless you take into account the previous time u wacked it/had sex
Thats longer than a smash game that cant be me
Average sex is 7 minutes??
I'll report
Supposedly it works but i wouldnt know
I wanna try that one day
we need more trans guys in porn cause they can just be permanently hard
That pineapple juice
That shit difficult
You gotta look like a model 24/7 365
I think most of it is probably body maintenence
Bruh you gotta fuck for hours
Stamina. Average sex is 7 min so like, you gotta last longer for the film
It's a lot tbh
like i know the job isn't sunshine and rainbows but like what are the challenges of working in porn
i wonder what it takes to be a guy in porn
it doesn't help that men in porn aren't that hot to me imo
i hate seeing men in porn and i'm a straight sjw
And if it was two women it would be fine and that also seems to be how most guys feel, which could reduce the homophobic element? But like only partially
And I know like you arent obligated to be interested in watching that but I dont know if its wrong to feel uncomfortable
Also in general someone you are not attracted to acting sexual would feel weird, men or not men
I really dont think I have any objections to gay sex but I wouldnt want to see it
Like most things w porn it lies to you in a ton f ways and one of those lies is like how to behave in a sexual relationship
I mean its not like you have a problem with men on men, just men in general
Its always what made me uncomfortable
If that makes sense
Men in porn dont act like human beings
Part of it could very well be that like
During puberty I couldnt watch porn because men being there just felt so bad
It makes me feel like Im homophobic which bothers me
So yes
I hate looking at men in most contexts
Idk if its wrong of me but Ive always disliked seeing guys in porn or anything
Does anyone else get discomforted by seeing men being sexual
But we also gather age
I guess people say the landscape passes by if you're driving
or are we moving forward relative to it
I agree
We should say that time arrives and we gather it
does the time we experience pass us by
why is time said to pass
althoug
anyway I hope nobody takes the passage of time for granted
LSD
What did you eat?
like that one guy in Bleach
like time would have passed normally but my consciousness would have been in that second forever
well it was probably only my perception that was being extended
I think it would have been a necessary sacrifice
Ready for some being that transcends time
Wait that means we would have been preserved too
yeah but in a relatively hellish state
So if you didnt think specific you would have lived forever?
I don't know if it was the most fucked up I've ever been or the most powerful
but then I entered a state of mind where I could only make time pass by consciously thinking about specific things
and for a while I kept seeing demons in my bed
yo so I ate something bad over the weekend and got sick and barely slept Sunday night
sometimes it be like that tho
What

the statement is not true
if i never do it,
i dont believe you
If you hold space when typing on an iPhone you can move the cursor around like a mouse
I almost thanked myself in the body of my email
If you dont space out the closing of your email properly it looks like youre talking to yourself
Especially since when it came out it wouldnt have felt like an accepted phrase
Back to the Future is such a great title
Even though those arent stocks
Back to the future technically
Name one
All those movies/media that does that though
understandable
The verdict is it would be illegal
I asked our LBS teacher about getting knowledge from the future to inside trade in the present

in one year
contact me
I'll get the gun
i'll go get the radio
LOOOOL
yeah that's what they could say in the other universe, but it would be for a short distance

This is taking as long as rhode island
but in the grand scheme of things one year is nothin
cause our concept of years is that they're a very long amount of time
we're referring to the concept of years not actual years
when we say something is taking "years"
lol
so yeah it is weirdly hard for a year to be one year ago lol
on december 31st 11:59pm, 2018 still happened less than a year ago
well this is a different comparison too
it would be 2 hours
if it was 5:00 p.m., would it be an hour since it was 3:something
*ago
for it to be considered a full year afo
the full year has to complete
cause 365 days passed
if something happened on april 16th 2018, we could say it happened a year ago
no that will be a year from the beginning of 2019
cause 2019 wouldnt have been completed yet
no the first instant of 2020 will mark that
the last instant of 2019 will be when 2018 is a year ago
no
and it will always be less than a year ago for all of 2019
2018 was less than a year ago
so for that whole year the previous year was less than a year ago
well I'm saying like 2018 wasn't a year ago right
the second its the next year the previous year is over
its the whole year
what do you mean vast majority
and then you're in the next year
like for the vast majority of the year, the previous year is less than one year ago
isn't that strange
it's weirdly hard for a year to be one year ago
today I was thinking
which reminds me
1 thing isn't
everything is either bigger or smaller than rhode island
we're gonna need a bigger state
yo beijing is 5 times bigger than rhode island wtf
rhode island is the perfect midpoint for size comparisons of all things
Like in a vacuum, the average thing you could compare to Rhode Island is smaller, but when you're talking on state scale, I think most things would be expected to be larger, unless you were saying this city is the size of Rhode Island
yeah i guess rhode island is a pretty good candidtate
oh then thats small
Well what if they just said this country is this size of Rhode Island
but not necessarily if they said it was rhode island sized
"This cookie is the rhode island of this cookie jar"
well maybe if they phrased it like
but most likely if you're talking about something that could conceivably by state-sized, I feel like Rhode Island is more likely to convey that it's small
like, the size of something is way bigger conceptually
i feel like it is
is the size of rhode island a concept
like, the smallest it can be is a literal state
its at minimum state sized
rhode island is the size of rhode island
i'd hear it as something is very large
if someone said something was the size of rhode island
big
If something was the size of Rhode Island, would it be big or small
That cutscene sad as fuck
If you happen to lose all your pikmin and render the race extinct, it still lets out a single seed for your troubles
Though there's definitely a level of sentience to the onion
It definitely isn't that, but it could be
It could be two pikmin fucking and using carcasses and pellets for nutrients
I think the Onion is so vague in its execution that we can't be sure
also doesnt include needing to reproduce using your own species but i thought that was the basis for why viruses are not alive
wait this is unreadable
Homeostasis: regulation of the internal environment to maintain a constant state; for example, sweating to reduce temperature Organization: being structurally composed of one or more cells  the basic units of life Metabolism: transformation of energy by converting chemicals and energy into cellular components (anabolism) and decomposing organic matter (catabolism). Living things require energy to maintain internal organization (homeostasis) and to produce the other phenomena associated with life. Growth: maintenance of a higher rate of anabolism than catabolism. A growing organism increases in size in all of its parts, rather than simply accumulating matter. Adaptation: the ability to change over time in response to the environment. This ability is fundamental to the process of evolution and is determined by the organism's heredity, diet, and external factors. Response to stimuli: a response can take many forms, from the contraction of a unicellular organism to external chemicals, to complex reactions involving all the senses of multicellular organisms. A response is often expressed by motion; for example, the leaves of a plant turning toward the sun (phototropism), and chemotaxis. Reproduction: the ability to produce new individual organisms, either asexually from a single parent organism or sexually from two parent organisms.
Hmm so what's the basis for being considered alive
but you can kill viruses
Pikmin are alive simply from the implication that they can be killed imo
when you die you go to new game+
but what happens when we live?
we always ask what happens when we die
how can we trust that we're actually alive
there's a checklist of things
i can't find anything saying mules are scientifically alive
what is being alive?
Life is but a dream~
mules as in donkey horse babbies?
and photons arent even technically confirmed to exist, so the way we classify light might be different in the future when we understand it better
are mules alive
photons dont have a nucleus, and idk if they are even classified as matter, so the as above so below theory couldnt even apply as like, a way to explain that it has consciousness on a quantum level
@Yaseen if pikmin require onions to reproduce and can't reproduce on their own, are pikmin alive
yea actually no
do photons exist where there is no light
like they're everywhere at once and stuff but then they're in a bose einstein condensate and they're like what the fuck
much like how we experience time
but they would be vaguely aware of it in a relatively trackable manner
do you ever think like what does a photon perceive
if they had the ability to sense, they would be sensing an infinite amount of locations happening simultaneously
so they are moving through space in a way that is imperceptible to them
this is all happening at once
but also because they dont experience time
or below a planet's crust
so honestly most of their group chat conversations are in space
just so they wouldnt be boring holes into planets moving at thousands of miles an hour when they appear
so they phase through atoms, light, planets, and other celestial objects
but they arent physical
so like, these entities would just be static figures locked into place in the ever expanding void of space
travel
time
if we understood the nature of how we move through time we discover time travel
to be able to control it
What would it mean to know
well we dont actually know how we move through time
there time would be 3d
I presume
well their moving through distance would be like our moving through time
because we can also fuck with time by moving at sufficient speeds
why are they moving forward at all
I don't know how comparable that is to our always moving forward through time
if they're always moving forward in distance, and can move through time, that would allow them to effectively move through distance, though only on that one axis
well the thing is though
what does that even mean
but time not
they would probably view distance as always moving forward
which entity
like in an auto scroll level
i feel like the entities life span would be displacement based
and we're are actually a corrupt business guy using time travel for selfish interests
or maybe the movie was about the son in the first place
which wraps up nicely within this same scene but in reverse and through a quick flashback life montage
Cue completely unrelated revenge story line of an orphaned son
"I just shot that guy's dad
future you hears a single gunshot
"I just shot a guy who found out about my radio"
Future you's voice: Hurry.
future you gives you the info and then you hear a single gunshot
and get replaced by a (hopefully) more successful version
it would cease to exist
but even then, after your future self told you the information
that would be the only plausible time travel applicated way
and they told you market information
that someone could be future you
and you communicate with someone from the future
one is hooked up so it sends waves to the future, and one sends waves through a black hole to the past
so lets imagine a scenario where you have a 2way temporal radio
Causing many other people to invest
And get caught
If you come back and invest in a stock because it will be good
Well it could also cause itself to happen
then that wouldnt work either cause you would like, immediately forget what youre doing and cause a paradox regardless
But if caughr it automatically will prob be bad
after you make the change, your memories of the past change
as in
In general, unless you are caught the trade would be good
cause like, if we're going with an idea of time travel where you're not conscious of it
i think we're going into it assuming that it works
cause theres a lot of factors at play in most of these supernatural questions
i dont think its necessarily important to the scenario
Imagine getting arrested for insider trading, and not even making a good trade in the process because you changed the future
because that decides whether or not you have an unfair advantage
it's important for the insider trading question
like what if going back in time makes it possible for the information you take back in time to not actually come true
thats a whole other conversation about time travel
ok about the insider trading question, what if the act of going back in time changes the timeline such that you aren't necessarily using "good" information
about leg amounts
or if i could telepathically tell people riddles
like, if i was some sort of judgement god
Whats a power that would be cool from that perspective
I would give it up unless i had cool powers
I'm so grateful to be able to move now
do you have a physical form
Would you give up your immortality for a lifetime of movement that is infinitely short by comparison
If you were an eternal entity that couldnt move
then they could probably use some sort of telepathy
so if they only exist mentally/digitally/conceptually
You would only be moving through time
well if you physically exist but you teleport that still counts as physical movement
or some such system
It could be like, if you manifest in the year 0, that's the letter A
Well what are some ways communication could work without physical movement
do they just reference words existing in different times
how do they operate the group chat
I guarantee that's what they're saying about our universe
How does anything exist
Or eyes
Wait do they not have legs
and they're like in their group chats theorycrafting about what if physical movement was possible
all entities could move through time as they please, but they have no control over spatial displacement
yo what if there was a universe where like
the truth behind the great depression
Allen then the stock would collapse lolol
Id argue that if time travel was thought to be possiblenit would be included
to the point where a substantial amount of people could have future knowledge at all times
from our LBS hw lol
well what if people time travel all the time
Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commissions Rule 10b5 prohibit undisclosed trading on inside corporate information by individuals who are under a duty of trust and confidence that prohibits them from secretly using such information for their personal advantage
If you state the info before you trade it prolly covers you but I don't know econ like that
I'm with Justin on this one
In the current time period where you're trading, the info you have is completely out of reach from the current public
Insider trading encapsulates morenthan just insider info
just info on the market from the future
the info is not from inside information though
Long as its stated its public info
People.can believe or not
Id say yes it covers you
does that cover you
And what if you publicly state the info before you trade
As in, if you're trading based on the knowledge that a company isn't going to exist in 2 years, but nobody in the present knows, is that nonpublic info?
Well does it need to be known by at least one person in the present though
I mean, technically thats nonpublic info
I feel like too large of a component of insider training is that it's nonpublic information
I disagree
You have information the rest of the market doesnt have
Yes
is it insider trading if you come from the future and trade stocks off the future?
he's powering up his power shot
Actually in 8 it's called a Power Shot
Charge Shot
what do you call mega man's forward smash
Charging charge shot sounds dumb, but I can accept that the fault lies in the move rather than in the phrase
lmao
and chris just fuckin punching you in the neck
imagine having like a lukewarm opinion on something
Chris check whatsapp
when he goes extreme chris
i love chris
powering up charge shot
or is it better to say like
If you believe anything different I hate you
I think the former
is it proper to say samus is charging her charge shot, or charging her shot
Heres to thunking about deep stuff
Christian sent an attachment.
Everyone knows Allen waits until block 5
Thats godlike
We were like 6 blocks from going rock climbing at 11pm before I folded
Allen is the king of bluff calling Chris you fool
Next questions
Thanks
Yes and no
2 questions
Mega Gastly "Mega Gastly Gastly" Gastly added Christian Lui to the group.
Wait why are you mad at that Chris
Yaseen's point about the subway infrastructure and future-proofing is really important. Also the subway is hard to improve on because it's constantly being relied on. It's like trying to do open heart surgery
LIght
LI players
does anyone drive to xeno tho
Lirr monthly passes are getting discounted
Events that happen around here that are low cost lose most of their clientele since they have to pay an extra $10. (Like xeno lol)
Also depending on where you enter there is already a toll for cars to enter NY
Investments of $10 will most likely go nowhere
The $10 for MTA is dumb
This article actually explains a lot of the technical issues with the MTA
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/09/nyregion/subway-crisis-mta-decisions-signals-rules.html
oooooo that makes sense
They drive lol
Not sure but the point is that upstate people dont care
Actually maybe not
Like different department altogether, pretty sure MTA only refers to NYC shit
Nah that's like the upstate shit
does the mta also do upstate transportation?
And so many people upstate dont give 2 shits about my commute
Thats odd
I didnt know that
But yeah the state pays for the MTA
More the former
Yes and yes
you mean like the literal infrastructure of the subway lines or like the governmental structure of the mta ppl/higher ups
Just make the MTA city paid instead of state paid
Which is what Fucker Carlson advocates for
I know people worry about inefficient government but the solution to that isnt let everyone fend for themselves
It wasn't built to be as future proof as it needed to be
^
The mta just needs like revamped infrastructure as a whole
also some ppl say like giving money to the mta is like throwing your money in a fireplace so idk
I hadnt thought of that
Ohhhhh
but arguments against that are that poor ppl generally don't drive into manhattan and use the mta and also that there would be exemptions for low income ppl
my first reaction was that it sounds like a paywall to enter manhattan and it'd make the socioeconomic divide worse where poor ppl can't even go into manhattan for work
On one hand plans to reduce road congestion is good
Lemme think
Oh shittt
the goal is to reduce traffic in the most congested areas and to use that money for the mta
basically if you drive into manhattan below 60th st you need to pay a $10+ toll
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/nyregion/what-is-congestion-pricing.html
Bless you
Whats that
what do you guys think about the nyc congestion pricing plan
That too yeah lol
Nah its because they made 3 games all on the ps3
And it's on the PS3 lol
Maybe it's because the concept has been done better
I'm surprised no one talks about it anymore, it seemed pretty ahead of its time
The Minecraft before Minecraft
Thank god someone remembers this game

allen?

I gotta finish Avatar*
I gotta finish Sapiens*  *read past chapter 1
Or something along those lines
Humans also developed duller teeth I believe once we learned to cook
it's a solid emergency fun fact
The reason is that humans ate mostly tougher foods which lead to bigger lower jaws or something but farming led to humans developing smaller jaws capable of making those sounds
I research FoV first
do you usually research F or V first
damn it's just like playing civ
Humans couldn't make F or V sounds before agriculture
Then look at a human brain
Then look at a chimp brain
Like look at a chicken brain
Like it constantly fascinates me how many orders of magnitude intelligence increases as brains get bigger
Yeah for sure
so like words/sounds/etc don't come from nowhere they come from????????
linguistics is awesome and also there's this https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect
Even laws of science are based at their core on axioms that can't be proven. We still accept them because those laws explain the world and can make predictions
I want the gAme
Agreed
Its just fascinating
I mean, it's useful to accept that words mean things even when they technically don't
Mhm! Its one of those social bonding things thats probably the most important tonlike forming communities
*accept
Language is so interesting tho. Like nothing means anything except we except it does?
Thats valid
I definitely fead that as t horny games..
This sounds extremely cool
https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/kb4w5n/playing-the-birth-and-death-of-language-in-dialect
https://thornygames.com/pages/dialect
i can be satisfied with that
the goal of tonight is to get all the dialogue in
thanks Barold
Where To: New HQ sounds great already imo
something with hq in the name
also i need a name for the show thats better than "where to: new hq"
yes
the contest is just lore to set up the game right?
cuz nyc got disqualified basically
but shes happy that nyc took a stand against it
hopeless person is lke sad and frustrated
the contest doesnt matter tho
is the hopeless person sad
the contest is to see where they'll come
whether or not they approve?
but they're just taking a stance on it
so everyone is already agreeing that amazon is going to come
i thought "if a congressperson wants them there theyll just end up there"
thats what i meant by hopeless, sorry i wasnt clear
i think theres hope in stopping them from coming to your city
i dont think amazon helps the situation
or can amazon help
nah
is it hopeless
what do you think
like a LOT like the bachelor
its gonna kinda be like the bachelor
theyre all just gonna be shelling out billions of dollars
the contestants dont matter
oooh
yeah basically
so the game is about watching tv basically
so they dont actually matter and we can just think of all of them as the same?
the three contestants are just whos left on the show
and like everyone in the country is watching it like its the bachelor final episode
why are there 3 congresspeople contestants then
the show is being broadcast nationwide
each friend is someone watching the show, all on your apartments tv
sorry no
so each friend is corresponding to a congressperson?
1 person is hopeless 1 perrson thinks amazon is gonna really help the community and thinks theyre really cool third person is "whatever you think" cuz thats the mc
the three people watching the show (you and your two friends) represent like 3 approaches to how people feel about amazon
not 3 distinct reasons more like
so you're looking for 3 distinct reasons why contestants would persuade amazon to come to their state
its sharktank in what theyre giving, its american idol in terms of production value
thank you i forgot the name of that show
its sharktank style
raleigh, indianapolis and chicago
or performing
like, are they giving a presentation
is it more sharktank style or american idol style
and now its down to the final 3
so every city is a contestant
the show itself is basically american idol but instead of singing, city congressmen are offering amazon as many benefits as they can until amazon bites at one of them
that a newscaster or some host is saying
nah so
so are they responding to headlines basically
dont we all
Replicate what Ryan Seacret is saying on tv
Well I also have to like
Oh shword lemme get to my laptop
lets have the conversation right now and you can just copy and paste
in this case
How do I start writing when its due tomorrow and theres so much to go
read the manga
Thats how I feel
How do you even start one piece when youre 800 episodes behind
is actually pretty smart in an ironic way
You know that anti tweet where hes like
"hurr durr amazon is bad"
Im also like
Thank you I appreciate that
even
just based on your current ability and standards
I keep getting distracted like spongebob writing the essay
i feel like anything you write will be at minimum decently smart
Three characters
I am on maybe the third slide
how many characters do you have
Im so paralyzed by wanting to sound smart and good because everyone in this class is smart
or can you not think of any
so what conversation are you stuck on
Cuz I cant think of doing anything else
Yes Im literally solely writing dialogue for now
so you're writing dialogue?
Sorry your watching the competition with your friends in your apartment
A text game about watching a competition where cities bid for amazons approval with your friends
what are you writing for
I havent written fiction in so long
what are you writing about
Ive had writers block for 12 hours
How the fuck do you write
Melee is dead

Alllennn!!!~~~

Was reading up on anxiety regarding applying to stuff and found this, very insughtful
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good
I love Andy
I love Chris
Honestly mad problems would be solved if there was more obesity
It's time to tip the scales
Holy shit Chris is absolutely right
Can there be obesity without hunger?


We should all fuck robots
Obesity and world hunger shouldn't exist simultaneously
Umm
We should create a eugenic utopia
They were right
Cause robots thought humans were all criminal
But the matrix is the ultimate jail scenario
As people possibly already do
Otherwise I guess you could just tell people
I worry about people on the outside being able to tamper with it and/or me
I mean I feel like you would need to have those powers in order to not accept it, in a meaningful way
like when you're aware that it's fake so you become anime
only if i had super matrix powers like neo
Seems bad
Would you guys be okay with being in the matrix
The humans are physically in pods yeah
Or if the population was all mango
If like, robots were controlling it
Cause that's the only way 95% of the population would be in jail
The humans are physically somewhere right
Um I guess its like a mental jail?
There was a human society in zion
Robots are morally objective
Is the matrix a jail
You are allowed to though even if you physically cant, but it would be more accurate to say a jail is a place specifically designated as somewhere people cant leave
but like you couldn't leave earth for the past bajillion years
That could be the only requirement though
I think the foundational requirement is you cant leave
Well lets start from scratch
Yeah thats another reason for me to ask what else defines jail
The relative liberties thing is interesting though because you could have a world where everyone has less liberty than what prisoners in our world have, but they wouldnt be in jail if that was the norm
it's like how jail has currency which is cigarettes and bag ramen
Yeah I get that
I wasnt saying they have the same liberties, but like if a small group of people put most of society in jail, the people in jail would probably still be most of society if that makes sense
Bc if jail and non jail have the same liberties what is jail
I meant more in a sense of if its not an instution that removes liberties as punishment what else defines it
The people in power
Then what defines jail
In theory at least
There are dystopian societies with like no liberties all around though
You lose out on a lot of liberties which I think is my objection
Idk jail doesn't sound like a society no matter how many people are in it
Because at that point whos to even say that the 5% of people are the ones with the correct moral values, right
But if it was like 95% of people were in jail, it feels more like society, and [people not in jail]
Yeah but wouldn't that hold regardless of percentage
Putting aside minor reservations, just generally speaking
You could reasonably refer to them as criminals and society, right
If 10% of the population is in jail
like societies can have fringes but there isn't a main society
i feel like there isn't a main society
Or everyone is terrible
Non jail is still society but maybe needs to start reconsidering the values by which they send away majority population?
If you send people away one at a time
Well at what point does it become that
I think plurality is like an implied factor of society
Wouldnt that then be personal values
Is he society
Like say only 1 person has social values
i think a society is a group of people big enough for social dynamics to emerge in it and a community it is a group of people who are looking out for each other
Not until criminals get punished
As for the social value thing, I think that gets weirder if the example is more extreme
We definitely do not live in a smash society
Like you can say the smash community but not really the smash society
Like regardless of size?
I think theyre interchangeable sometimes but overall community is a looser term
But since half of this population is being sent away for lack of adhering to the society values, doesnt that make non-jail the main society for adhering to them?
And then one is the bigger / main one
If half the population is ostensibly separated in jail I feel like its like cutting the mass in half
What differs a society from a community
Or a society is like a coagulated mass of vaguely connected people

Paul?
Its more like a range of social statuses

I dont think a society is a physical place
gay society is the main one
The main society chat
is china or india the main society
Is every group chat we have a society
Which would suggest that society has some sort of center
The fringes of society exist
are there main societies
is society just like any group of people where things come out of it like 500 ppl isn't just 500 ppl, it's 500 ppl + racism or something
In hunger games most people are essentially on the level of criminals
Is culture a measure of society
nah cause being so totalitarian makes it have less culture or art or science or whatever

But would it be the main society
like an ultra totalitarian society
yea i think jail is like a society
https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1594422/jewish/Do-Jews-Believe-in-Hell.htm heres a good explanation. Its like a great celestial washing machine for your soul
Do you guys think if more than half of society was in jail, then at that point jail would be society
Ill try to find a source that explains it better
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superjail!
Theres sort of like a theory (i dont remember which rabbi) that gehennam which is like hell only reserved for the worst of humanity is like being launched from planet to planet forever

https://www.buttersafe.com/2012/03/29/moon-junior/
it would probably encourage recidivism
Instead of a death sentence its like a death sentence for everyone you know
you could actually get punished for 300 years like people do now but for real
Same
I need to watch interstellar again
Wait thats so fucked up if like a more severe sentence is the same duration but in a slower time
Every visit would go like the one scene from Interstellar as you get another piece of your loved one's fast forwarded life :(
Actually dont astronauts essentially already go to space jail
Idk as soon as any potential shit goes down the guards could turn off gravity
when you go back to earth you'd become physically weaker and less able to commit crime
the prison break would be so anime
Because if I looked out of my window and saw a dirty courtyard or whatever Id probably just be mad but if it was in space I would reflect more on like my significance in the cosmos
I feel like Id be more repentant in space
They didnt name it jupithim though did they
i guess woman's australia and men's australia was the same
Yeah cuz men go to jupiter to get more stupider
would women's jail and men's jail be 2 different planets
There should be a show thats literally orange is the new black but in slightly lower gravity
Wakanda Pog
space jail would be all black ppl and then we'd basically have black planet
Well the prison system is messy because its supposed to do like 3 things at once
Wait space jail is a funny show
i feel like part of it is that they take the criminals and move them elsewhere to make the country safer regardless of justice
Like if someone committed a crime against you, and their punishment was getting sent to Australia forever, would you be satisfied
And does that matter
Does banishment serve justice though, if its to a reasonably decent place
actually if a jail colony like australia existed nowadays it'd be like all black men
The twitch chat of antiquity
i think there were just way more male criminals or something so some absurd amount of australian ppl are descended from one woman who got sent to australia lmao
Would the Australian embassy be a jail
Theres a lot of planets to try
Maybe we should move everyone out of Australia and begin again, repeating the process once every hundreds of years as theyre rehabilitated by the passage of generations
And then those criminals treated the aboriginals like garbage
I think the cleanest solution was sending criminals to Australia
and in detention they can't take advantage of you
like at least when you leave detention you're like everyone else again
i feel like the main problem with prison is that once you go to prison you have no rights forever basically
Yo thats actually so poetic because like human morality is the reason that its hard to deal with humans who have erred morally
The reason prison has issues fundamentally from my perspective is because assuming the government dont go ham with executions theres a whole bunch of unrepentant people whose punishment boils down to sapping government resources
Allen check smashcon chat its urgent
And detention is like time out for juveniles so whatever
See the thing with that is that incarceration is essentially time out for adults right
It is when I have it
Like, is detention medieval
It would be different enough if you could send every potential prisoner to rehab instead of prison
like if we had rehab instead of prison is that different enough
wait what's the core idea that can't be messed with
I suppose its crime itself that is medieval, and drags prison back in time with it
Wait prison makes so much sense what do you mean
I mean theres a lot that can surely be changed in execution of the concept, but the idea itself seems difficult to mess with
Prison is such a strange concept because it seems really medieval but theres also few alternatives that arent extreme in some way
Nah it just needs food-water-and shelter
Like I get that all animals groom themselves but dang
This thing is held together with tape and bits of string
The human body requires so much upkeep
lets call that a lucky guess

Yeah
@Allen Wu
was the streamer nicro
Also Ive never heard anyone say anything other than band aid
Same with Kleenex
The ultimate flex
Where the brand name replaces the generic name in usage
But it's the same case with Purrell and Band-Aid
I forgot the name of this sorta thing
Did you guys know that the nonbrand name of what Velcro is is hook-and-loop fasteners
Yeah they'd be retro by obligation sorta lol
like Velcro and generic Velcro
like in a couple of decades current games would be retro, but in a less specific way than the brand of retro that the SNES era owns
As a term it could be somewhat fixed in time, at the point where the term itself was most popular
The N64 is to 3D what the NES was to 2D
The N64 is definitely far more "retro" than the Gamecube will be when the time comes for it, simply for how primitive the games were for the 3D genre
Thats a good point
But that's kinda unrealistic to maintain
I think for a lot of people "retro" just means the NES or SNES era
there's something to be felt in there
Games like SM64 go down with the ship eventually, even if not really on their own merits
But I guess also games inevitably become retro no matter what eventually
One loose definition of retro could be like, at some point in time nobody was playing it
And it used to be huge enough to have TV commercials
Like Id call Super Monkey Ball retro as a series because I feel like I havent seen it in forever even though I think theyre still making games?
Keeping in mind that the term is inherently pretty arbitrary of course
I think they can be
Are individual games retro
*and Switch
My mom still calls the Wii U and and PSP Switch a DS
I think it might be too in the public consciousness still
DS maybe
When games from a console stop being played across the board it can cross into that category
DS
Yeah Id say so
Retro retro
GBA?
Moving on
Hot take
Yeah I was thinking Melee is singlehandedly holding the GameCube above the retro line
Mario Kart wii is lowkey as good as double dash, if not better
Once Melee dies
GC?
Agree
The N64 is solidly retro I would say
Theres a Wii in the lounge here and me and my least nerdy friends hopped on it like nobodys business, but we werent like oh the memories we were like yo Mario Kart
Made me wonder where the line currently is
I saw someone streaming Wii Sports in the retro category on twitch
I dont think so its too universal to be retro if that makes sense
Is the Wii retro
Hoodies
I love my glasses. Im Velma without my glasses
Glasses arent clothes
Not counting glasses
I would GLADLY be naked except for a green baseball tee
Uh my favorite shirt is my Mob Psycho shirt
Yo u ever think about how bowser wears a spiked choker. Literally a muscular goth single dad
Whats everyones most important article of clothing
I can be goth Mickey Mouse
Yeah it's only $15
Oh nelly
you can buy one yourself
dellapi do you want it
Bruh

Thats $15/clothe
A SPIKY LEARHER-
A pair of pants is like $30
Cuz you bet your ass Im wearin that shit on a date
i have a spiky leather bra
Wait over $100 for 5 clothes is actually maaad cheap
Which I have to wash for tomorrow
Two socks, two shoes, and a collar
The most goth thing i own is currently my akatsuki shirt
There is hope left in the world
the sad part is that's like 5 clothes
i bought over $100 of goth clothes online for some reason, i'm omw
Someone call for me
Where are my goth girls
that's at chris, i support paul

How do I thumbs down harder
That should be everyones least favorite part of society
Goth girls that step on you and call you names aren't assigned to you
Ikr
Well that doesnt mean its okay to get caught
the college scandal is so weird cause i thought everyone already knew rich ppl do that???
Paul whats your least favorite part of society
We really do live in a society nowadays
Not urban
Maybe rural is like that
like they recruit at schools with good sports programs and those schools probably have good programs cause they have money to hire good coaches and get good equipment and travel
Only like bougie athletics but who plays those
All you need is whatever my solo queue teammates had to practice league
i feel like athletics do too
Also track too
Academics has a lot to do with the persons economic and social background
only basketball football and soccer are like that
Yoshiya is Joshuas real name
As long as you have a ball and a hoop you can practice athletics
Because athletics is usually grouped with lower income students that dont have the best schools around
why is it not like community service or jobs taken to support yourself in high school
but why is the skill athletics
I want the math guy to drop a mound of trash on me
But now they are helping people that have different skills not akinned to test taking
i was like who the shit is yoshiya
Either way they are helping someone less privileged
Shoutout to Yoshiya Kiryu. Pour one out for a real one
The gamers
they should take the spots that go to athletes and give it to less privileged smart kids with potential that get screwed over by systems
now it's only like just normal evil
if there wasn't financial aid it'd be blatant evil
Also did somebody say TWEWY
thank goodness for financial aid
If its the only way less privileged kids can get to these colleges then it might balance out
But youre auditioning to see if you can give them all your moneybags
Like I know this is very living in a society
Ever think about how hard you have to work to get into a college you like and then you gotta give them money to seal the deal
Everything except tin pin slammer already left my head
Good point
cause it's just to milk kids for all the money they can take in
isn't colleges treating athletes poorly another reason why it's like wait why is getting into a school cause of athletics a thing
He has
Has Allen played TWEWY
Tin pin slammer
yea i was thinking crew and lacrosse LMAO
Unless it is rowing
I see sports more helping the poor than the rich
College Athletes get fucked super hard from what I hear so Im afraid of criticizing the ability to go to good colleges based on athletics
Well also the Ivy League is literally a sports league
and then of course the sports ppl take it cause it's like a path to being way socioeconomically advantaged
I feel like sports are seen an an essential extracurricular at all schools
like the ivy leagues are so bad at sports generally, why do they recruit sports ppl
In the last few years theres been talk of esports scholarships and in general more integration between gaming and schools which feels conceptually but also the main difference between that and traditional sports is just cultural
From what Ive seen people in passing are usually like my school is good/bad rather than getting more nuanced about what is good and what is bad
I did esports
I dont think Ive ever really thought about it or encountered anyone in that situation as far as Im aware
and partially leads to richer kids going to good schools
yea same i just feel like it seems odd
I never did any athletics in college so I dont feel equipped to address this further
i mean i feel like players maybe not wanting to go pro or having other choices is not related to kids with bad academics and good athletics going to schools with good academics and bad athletics
Its an actual mess
Players get treated like shit by the organized leagues tho
Plus people who arent sure if they want to go pro might like having other options
Not everyone gets into every school they want to
Plus schools give recruiters places to go to find players. The alternative is what, holding auditions? Not nearly as telling as watching a college game
shouldn't they go to like a school that is top ranked for sports and not like a school top ranked for academics with bad sports tho
I mean you need to train to be a professional athlete somewhere right
besides that it gets the school money
like i'm not saying it shouldn't be a thing but i actually don't get why
i never understood why you can get into a school for athletics
Im not sure how I feel about it because part of my instinct is to believe it would make more sense for that to be the case but also the part of me that would have that perspective is  explicitly biased, plus I suppose theres no real objective criteria for what educational institutions should or shouldnt care about
The college scandal stuff made me realize that the entire sports facet of the education system is so established that I never thought to question it but its interesting to imagine a world in which athletics are decoupled from academics
Number 3 was my first crush
I had a crush on Numbah 362
Yo KND was the shit
Its not random, which some people would argue
The creativity stems from seeing how far can they push the rule while still keeping it in mind
If the creators did not ground the idea to the fact that they are kids, their would be less creativity. Like imagine if they just had a secret metal base and fought with fists or normal weapons
Also we can see through the lenses of kids what is evil, and we get that dentist dude, the common cold, and that grandma with the bad cooking
And they continuously build off that idea
More wood (2*4 technology) than what an adult would make
They are kids, so their tools are simple and spiratic
KND is really good with that
Like using toilet paper to scale a mountain   It's not that you CAN'T, there's no rule against it, but in our minds that's not what that does
There don't need to be definite rules but pre existing notions on how things work general set the stage for creativity imo
like inventions solve problems but what about fiction
Creative hentai like the squid stuff can be seen as stemming from the idea of we are making sex through the medium of paper, what does that give us that the real world does not and what looks like a dick
or a lot of fiction in general
like the mickey mouse cartoons
ok what restrictions led to disney
Lack of sex?
like what restrictions led to hentai
now i'm thinking of things that exist and what restrictions led to them
like what about spirited away
Or heard of it
I havent seen the movie
that shit came out of nowhere
like what about the guy who made the movie the lobster
The most common one is imposing rules in narrative on your world
This question kind of requires a definition of creativity. What is creativity in the context of this question?
Or complementary colors
Or smart marketing using the color of their product as a rule for the color scheme of their ads to make something that meshes better
Vegan burgers is probably a good one. They only exist because people self-imposed a restriction of food
But let me think of a smaller example
I used big examples to make my point
and it's not like you can have a world where you can do literally anything
cause like all these things are like people creating things to overcome things they couldn't do otherwise
what would no rules or restrictions look like then
Or even in cinema a lot of the creativity of the worlds have to have set rules the audience can grasp
Like the elcor in mass effect if anyone has played that
And a lot of the creative functional aliens stem from slight deviation from this conception
And biology
Or a lot of our ideas of how aliens should look comes from our knowledge of basic anatomy
Which led to airplanes
Like we would not think about flying if there was no law of gravity
like what's an example of creativity with rules and restrictions
Can there be creativity without rules and restrictions
"Are you Squidward? That's OK, take your time."
Hes not leavin Orville...ya got your night stick ready?
Better be canned bread
spit it
From the squid ward only resort
Also a line stuck in my head
"George he's onto us!"
The iron butt was the joke of the milenium
i like how that episode ended with a family being like "this show sucked" and turning the tv off
I'm a sick fuck I like a quick  *spank line*
Dang they really thought of a plot just to include this scene
paul visiting us

Who needs employment omw

We're following in the footsteps of the greatest philosophers

Brain Expansion
All of us
Paul is an ass mommy
he's got mad charisma
No thats how you pronounce my name
but i find might guy super hot in terms of personality
is his name pronounced ass ma
probably
is asuma the hottest guy
Women already look at me and I die
yea i barely remember kurenai
I cant believe thao thinks for a second she isnt a weeb
Delappi that already happens to me
Asuma: what if he died
Kurenai is like Tenten probably hot but does absolutely nothing to remember her by
power couple
Kurenai: what if a woman looked at you and you died
also asuma
ooooh yea kurenai is hot
Imagine character concept that is: what if a women flicked you and you died
Kurenai
Bulmarket
5 years younger vs. 5cm taller. the battle of the gods
TSUNADE
Bulmech
Bulma in a mech
Wait
Bulma
yea besides temari and tayuya
Temari
i can't think of other hot girls in naruto
for real? she got discount sasuke
whoa i didn't know that that's amazing
I love that ino married sai
Flute in butt thANKS
Im so glad Paul and I have consistently similar taste
Bruh bruhbruh bruh
Thao is absolutely right about Tenten
I looked her up
Like they don't appear at all in Shippuden from what I heard
Tayuya stick ur flute up my fuckin ass
tenten could've been hot if she existed
Curse marks and curse mark forms were hyper fuckin wasted in Naruto
HELL YEAH THAT WAS IT
Oh it's Tayuya apparently
extra hot
and then when she turns evil and brown
omg flute girl is so hot and i have no idea what her name is
I think shes conceptually attractive to me but I look at her and feel nothing for some reason
Concept: Tsunade
Psh
Never finding the naruto women super attractive
understandable
I have a weird weakness for girls with hats
Id let flute girl gangbang me
bell girl #3
I forgot flute girl
Temari #1, the flute girl #2
YO FLUTE GIRL
for some reason every woman Shikamaru fights was cute af

Nah the art style is meh
The absolute exception of course being Temari
Weirdly I never found any of the Naruto women super attractive maybe its because I started it before I could really be attracted to things
oh he's from shippuden
Yeah its dope
I remember his eyes being weird
The hot tree guy
Isnt he the tree guy
who's yamato again
LIKE
HIERARCHY:  KAKASHI ASUMA KURENAI YAMATO MIGHT GUY
WHOS LESS ATTRACTIVE
LIKE JUST TIER WISE
How. Fucking. Dare.
Might Guy is unfortunately one of the least attractive jonin
Uhhh rock lee probably
Guy if you have a dad complex
Tsukoyomi Im boutta head out
ok but michael, who's sexier: rock lee or might guy
You literally just dont have to be there
i bet people with genjutsu are probably really good at sex
I think Shino answers my question of whats worse than sex with more than one naruto!
i can't believe i'm going over every naruto character in my head trying to think how good they are at sex
Shino is probably kinky AF
I feel like when Kiba has sex its just called style
Thats fucking disgusting Barry how dare you
ok.... but... do u think.... kiba's favorite position.... is doggystle? (rimshot)
I think the only I can think of wanting less than sex with naruto is sex with narutos
shikamaru has shadow choke
Naruto can literally be either a girl harem or a guy harem
Choke me Papa Shika
Depends what you're into
I was thinking about it and canonically Shikamaru probably has the best sex jutsu right
fellas if you don't want a lady who can break your neck with a giant fan and summons weazels i don't know what to say
ye
And Temari beats the shit out of him
And also Shikamaru is awesome because he marries Temari who's cute af
Yeah about relationships and exclusivity I feel the same way as Thao

I see you there Barry
Sodane
Ohhh
No like, other people
Wait the old man was ignorant?
People will be ignorant by choice
This 70 year old white guy just came into gamestop and bought a 3ds and pokemon and talked to us about Gen-con and D&D and magic
He basically makes supports look cool
Shikamaru is the best man alive in naruto
Yes that me
Christopher..
Who
Im gonna raise them under the fundamental principle that if anime were real, Shikamaru would be their second dad yes
are u gonna raise your kids on video games and anime
Maybe in that way preschool educational TV shows are replacing the Catholic Church 
So now Im every parents favorite boy alive, statistically
Or to a lesser extent my parents like conditioned me around being the best possible guests for a family if I visited
Like even though the intricacies of Catholicism are kinda Fuck, being conditioned at an early age around the fundamental principles of like doing right to others was a thing Id want to condition my kids for obvi (though I probably wouldnt want to use religion to do it)
Sometimes things exist for a reason
But yeah it was a realization I had around then that conditioning isnt always bad
Thats my cap
Yeah I have the exact amount of allotment in my heart for a relationship, 8 close friends, and one game Im obsessed with at any given time
I like to give and receive more love than one person can give me usually
and if it wasn't exclusive that wouldn't be the same
Thats totally fair
but that's also cause i'm a huge bitch like i like to feel like he could pick anyone but he picked me and he sees something special in me
I feel like if you think it works and you like it, who cares how you got to that point
Get off your high horse and let people do the harmless things they like
honestly to me most of the value of a relationship comes from the fact that it's exclusive
Yeah I hate people who think monogamy cant work for people
I used to think I was brainwashed cuz my ex was like you only want an exclusive relationship because we live in a society and then I realized its both a thing Ive been conditioned for and a thing I like
Well sorta
Also our president is anti-vax lol
papers never gain traction among normal ppl but this one was just weirdly so big
But yeah it started with a paper
As if white suburban mom #4 billion is the subject of government influence
People like to feel intellectually superior to the sheeple even though trusting science is generally a good thing
Too many people paranoid about the government and whatnot
how did it start
"Muh freedums"
how did that paper gain such a movement
like one guy wrote a false paper
how is anti vax real
Couldn't really be anti-vax before vaccines lol
Or rather if anti-vax came into existence
So same as here
Yeah exactly
If anti-vax came back then I don't doubt incest could too
oooooh
But its a fetish because its so taboo
But not normal
Japan i think its fetishized
Its definitely not normal in Japan
maybe japan??? idk
it's normal in fe
I think the inescapable thing about incest is theres almost always an abuse of power
and then you fuck the world
i feel like poly is when you realize a mono relationship is unnecessary or like society pushes it on you so much but you don't have to
Who knows
Will there ever be a point where incest is normalized, I hope not but damn
It sounds like u have one arm
polyamory is a good word but monoamory is a bad word
Like I could do either but Im generally happier when I can have sex with people other than the one person Im dating sometimes
Behavior Id say
like is poly an identity or a behavior
I dont think so because its more of a choice
is being poly something that a person identifies as kind of like gay or straight
And since marriage scares me its p nice lol
Polyamory is having multiple lovers or a relationship open to other lovers whenever
Polygamy is having multiple spouses
you need to like already elevate to the level of gender barely existing to even think about it
honestly i can't wrap my head around nonbinary genders like what must that feel like
Polyarmory ?
I do it its generally great but not for everyone
I feel we are just outside the cusp of polygamy being a thing
Polygamy sucks but polyamory is rad
Overall our generation still hasnt caught on with NB people existing and the majority probably wont
Also polygamy
If my grandson fucks a goat Im disowning
Honestly probably genders outside the binary
Thats definitely one
Goat fucking
When we are 70+, what will we be ignorant to
You know how 70+ year olds are stereotypically ignorant to a lot of things we accept like race and sexuality
Added to the world I think
This thing has two in its name? Well we havent found the first one yet so well categorize it later
I always thought Mew being 151 was cool because it showed that human errors and lack of knowledge could be involved in creating the Pokdex
That's gonna be a problem because I'm not dependable in any way whatsoever
It depends on how rigorous your definition of ancestor is
Does Dolly the clone sheep's ancestor list include the OG Dolly?
Well does mewtwo really have ancestors though
Well let's just redact that to say all Pokemon other than Arceus
Even mewtwo
SHIT
All pokemon, even arceus
Which is part of the theory that Dittos are failed Mew clones
iirc Arceus is god, Mew is the common ancestor of all Pokemon
wow i know nothing
You can see in the image
and mew is 151
Mew is 151
ok mewtwo is 150
someone find out what number mew and mewtwo are
So it makes sense that it's 151
You can't actually catch mew in red and blue you know
Wait I thought m2 was 151
mewtwo is a masc of center enby
Like was the first Pokmon anyone saw bulbasaur
It makes so much sense
like arceus is god but mew is what
He's under the truck by the SS Anne cmon gamers
Does that really make sense though
Mew
Only like 2 people have actually seen new
what is mew
Mew might not actually exist
so i know nothing except the 9 starter evolutions :(
It's literally the index of all recorded pokemon
No it does make sense
so i'd guess mew is 150 and mewtwo is 151
Because it doesnt make sense
Cause it's the pokedex
Thats why I remember it
like he's gotta be after
and why would mew be after if she's mew and he's mewtwo
Ty thao i forgot that existed
151
151
In gen 1
is the last one 152 or 151
Wait allen what do you mean
Omw
paul turn on messenger data saver
I thought mew was the last one
All I know is Gabriel
i can't do this
wait is mew 151
i didn't know if mew was 150 or 152
No my fucking mobile data
To pass the test
How much time would you need to look at this before you got enough data
Andy my data

How can you know mewtwo but not mew
British columbia is such a weird name like those two words are so geographically far from it
I feel like i could list out most of gen 1 in dex order on a test
i know the 9 kanto starters and mewtwo and that's it
British Columbia
I aint havin nunavut
Yukon deez nuts
I think I could recall more of the exact pokedex number of Pokmon than I could the combination of cities and provinces
The people i know from Connecticut and Massachusetts are mad smart
Alolan rednecks
Idk the yukon was just ice rednecks
Cause like the further up state you go the more educated the people are
Toronto Joe
there's u of toronto ppl
I feel like they're cool
I want to know a Torontan person
Ive been meaning to go to Toronto actually
i definitely guessed them all wrong lmao
I've been to BC also
i could do none of these :(
I've been to the yukon
Let's do Ontario and bc
I would guess Quebec probably
Spring break
Let's go allen
I could do Ontario and BC
yea i only know toronto the city is near ny and vancouver is near cali

Its a city
or a city or both
Toronto is not a province
is toronto a province
I know some of them
Toronto is close to ny
would you know which rectangle they are i mean
North
Quebec
but like where are they
British columbia
i only know vancouver and toronto the cities and that's it
Like Montreal
Toronto
could anyone name any canadian province
If you gave somone out of country a map of America without the border lines inside they would not be able to guess where Cali is
New York is like a rotated Texas kinda
california looks like a bad c
Florida looks like it doesnt belong and it doesnt
a t
but lowercase
it looks like a T
I feel like Texas uses its shape more than Cali
Andy lol
As I kid I always knew where Texas was but not Cali lol
Disneyworld

also maybe texas
Without
i feel like florida's entire existence would be unknown
Like, movies and celebrities and sunshine and surfing
Texas and Florida
in the 48 contiguous states
like what could be easier than cali
As an idea
Hollywood isnt big though
Well Hollywood is more prominent globally anyway
i'd guess ny is giant
But they would need to know that or SF is in California
i think people would guess cali is big
They know
They've seen The Room
People wouldnt guess California is big
the golden gate bridge is like water
Well I only really know what Chinese non Americans know but I think they generally dont care enough about surfing to associate it with California
Thats like saying Hollywood is in America
Also where in India lol
I would not assume people would say Cali for Hollywood
You can definitely say India
Surfing kinda seems like it is pretty associated
Every foreigner has played California Games for the Commodore 64 don't even fight me on that
I know what bollywood is but I cant say where it is
I dont think people necessarily know Cali is near water
Hollywood?
California
I dont even hear about it much here
cali is big and water and that's not ethnocentric
I dont think foreign people know about California
People know about NY but which shape? Nah
I don't think you would mix them up
I said that Chris
The global idea of California, Texas, and NY is so distinguished
The easiness of California is ethnocentric
and then it's the biggest coast state
No one could guess NY state
i'd think like i know sf has a lot of water so it has to be on a coast
I know NO such thing
Lol WHAT
Andy you know Im coming lol
If I wasnt American Id probably guess Texas is California
But once you add variables like that how accurately can you determine whats the most identifiable
See whats what Im saying
Chris are you hungry and free
California is only identifiable if you know its long and West coast
In retrospect I should have kept thinking until I hit 31 presidents
i'm actually looking at these provinces like hey it's fujianese fish balls from hotpot and hainanese chicken rice
he doesn't even get a 2d space
he smol boi
Hong Kong is so tiny babby small ohmwygawd
i feel like tibet is on the easier side so it could be top 3 easiest even tho it's still impossible
cause this map makes it look like it is
is beijing a province
I just expected them to be bigger
Okay that was actually vaguely where i thought they were
Ohh
the b in the northeast
Wait which is Beijing
ok i was totally wrong they were the opposite of what i thought but like close enough
Which of these would be the easiest province to identify

maybe???
and i imagine shanghai is to the north where there's rivers or something or a lot of water
Like
i vaguely know where beijing is
Oh dang i'm shtoop
isn't beijing far from shanghai kind of
Is Beijing next to Shanghai
The idea of which one is easiest is so nebulous if theyre all too hard
Guys it's definitely Iowa
no but it's probably like almost the easiest
one of them has to be the easiest
Like could you say where Beijing is
The contiguous ones are too hard
but like contiguous
Alaska or Hawaii probably
like they're all way hard but i feel like california is the easiest for ppl in other countries cause it's so big too
The edge ones are easy cuz they define our borders but if you show someone else a map they might not know thats part of the US
which ones are the easiest for non americans
Saying Washington covers a president, a state, and a government district
Chinese people have like no idea where any states are within America
Theyre only easiest for Americans
like the edge ones
and after that idk maybe texas or florida
i feel like california is the easiest contiguous state
Well you could only know Hawaii
People outside the US know NY but might not know where
Unless youre like a toddler or something
I feel like it's impossible to only know 1 state
Getting california Texas and Florida is hard
some combination of those
florida
I guess thats true. I think the person i saw do it was Canadian
alaska hawaii california texas
yea so they'd only get 4
Most people in other countries dont know where states are
i probably couldn't get 18 states tbh
probably like ppl in other countries
Damn I missed a lot of easy ones
I was watching someone take a US geography test and they only got like 18 states on the first try and i wonder how many can correctly identify like exactly 4
I reached so deep that I hit tippecanoe and Tyler too lol
I just did this and got 21
there'd be a normal distribution for normal humans and then a smaller one centered on max presidents
what would the graphs even look like
They might cause every number to be covered
I think what could compromise it most is people who did know every president, but then forgot some over time
I mean, its quite possible with a sample
Theoretically if every person was tested on the number that they can name, Im not sure how reasonable it would be to expect 0 people to hit any single result
But going back to the president case specifically Im not sure
And this could be relevant to a bunch of other things like all Pokmon, etc.
Dont do me like this before my law class allen
I'm gonna learn exactly 31 presidents
Like theres probably some people out there who can name every element on the periodic table but it would be way weirder to know around 85% of them
And whether or not thats true I think the concept of knowledge dead zones is interesting
However its possible that there are some number values where nobody knows exactly that number of presidents, like say 31
True, maybe
The majority of Americans can probably name at least say 5-15 U.S. presidents and theres also a decent number of people who can name all presidents
I come bearing food for thought
Hello friends
@Andy Bow The blue jay was perched on my dad's car when I came from back from the bagel store
Geesums
That's literally like seeing a rare pokemon

Yo where did you see a blue jay??
Barrys gonna fuck the bird isnt he...
they're so good looking
Speaking of regular show, I saw a blue jay for the first time this morning
Geese are apparently really foul-tempered
I'm aboutta step in some tall grass
Watch out, the geese might morph into mecha-king ghidorah like in the 100th episode of regular show
Those geese were OD
Climate change is a sad but at least the geese are getting the warmth they came here for
Also flurries and shower? Its 50 and sunny rn
This makes no sense

awesome
But yeah Im excited to start researching
But Im in the subway stop
I got distracted reading this and walked past the subway stop
I fuckin saw that lol
Oh  Good
the past few days the rags were running headlines about how AOC is a hypocrite for driving a car in New York when she's pushing a Green New Deal
I've been getting facebook ads for a republican politician who's trying to get elected on the platform that he wanted amazon to come to new york
it's sickening
Staten Island is the conservative part of new york, so all the local rags were running a million stories about how evil the politicians that were against amazon coming to queens were and how much they hated jobs when amazon first fell back
City council in Seattle and trying to make productive change but being stifled by corporate influence   City council in queens and identifying the reality that Amazon May come back to queens   City council in (insert city here) that is tecogzninf that their city may be the next target and what actionable steps can be taken to ensure that the land belongs to the people that live there
right, you got this
And once I have that theoretical framework I can tackle a three act adventure structure
Wanting to ground my work in actual theory about how government subsidies work, why big tech picks the cities they do to sprout up headquarters, etc
Sorry Im also walking (here)
Me and my professor met and I was like this game is just me being cynical about Amazon and saying everythings falling to shit and nothing matters and we just talked and like
it's ok you're doing great
I need more research
Its so rough
michael i'm hype as fuck to see that game
Im energized
Just what I needed

I feel compelled to share an irrelevant eric andre meme
And I think I might fuck around and apply for a social science grant for it
Cities
Oh shiiiiit Im getting a fuckinf brain blast for the game Im making about Amazon headquarters fuckinf ciries
in conclusion:
considering brain expansion just talked about black people and scientology
hold up i got the perfect video
ye
Imean, hollywood cults are fucking crazy
with like way more power than some backwater cult
from what i hear scientologists are just straight up fuckin cultists
Yeah fuck scientology
fuck scientology though
true
I think i just accept that all good things come with the capacity of equal harm, therefore the tremendous good religion can accomplish comes with the potential for tremendous harm
Yeah
Also, like any creed, it makes justification of atrocity easier
like hinduism straight up has a caste system. some sects of buddhism views women as inherently impure similarly to christians
I think the issue with religion is that it is inherently unchanging (a god beyond time doesnt change with time) therefore much of its current problems stem from the past and things done in its name
I think there's no major religion that's innocent

Fucking looking like a apex lvl 100
But i know the killcount for christianity is like, 9 times islams
Ye
Did someone say evangeli-
I could be mistaken about judaism and islam
In order i think the kill count is christianity, judaism, islam (from greatest to smallest)
I mean, so do jewish people and muslims vs each other in the middle east. All 3 monotheistic religions have mega blood on their hands
eh, evangelists as a group still heavily damage american politics
500 years ago, i mightve said otherwise tho
Agreed, but i think the societal benefit of belonging and general cold war rather than bloody crusades now outweighs the risk
nationalism is probably the only other thing as inherently toxic
well the texts on which religions are based specifically and uniquely sow seeds of extremism, moreso than other ideologies
To say religion is bad because it allows extremists to exist is to say all groups are bad imo
Interpretation is incredibly imporrant, i definitely agree. But all groups chalk up room for extremism by nature
Hot take: the mormon afterlife is the most feasible for a christian religon to believe
Like, people don't necessarily absorb those attitudes about non-believers but the major texts themselves almost always imply those attitudes which always leaves room for extremism
But i dont think patronization is a viable reason to call religion terrible
Oh, agree
Destroyed is some extremist shit. And idk but fuck all extremists
"Save" can be pretty patronizing
Punished is.... less common in my experience
Saved is the pure sense for most religions
Well the unique thing about religion is how it views the "outgroup." most major religions view non-believers to be people who need to either be "saved" "punished" or "destroyed"
Olimar is lame
Otherwise known as  Dont lewd isabelle Uhall fridays at 7
Yeah its an agreed upon list of creeds and values and usually some area designated for worship
And just like in other communities, its easy to turn a blind eye to the rot in it to feel like you belong
Atleadt, in theory
What is religion but a set of people who believe what you believe and who support your lifestyle?
Its really easy to see whats desirable about org relig
The core-a gaming video on communities relates gaming communities to organized religion a lot
This guy isn't even poor or anything
I find religion, while not being a thing i can accept myself, to be extraordinarily helpful for people. My family has made it through some hard times with its help. The issue is religion is rarely implimented in its purest sense, and corrupted religion might be the worst thing in existence

good point
True, but it manifests them in an easily digestible way
Everything that's good about organized religion isn't inherent or unique to organized religion though
Organized religion is the biggest bane and boon (simultaneously) to society
i know this is an r/atheist-ass opinion but organized religion is a fucking blight on the world. not religion as a whole but organized religion is just... so fucked
Are you thinking of creationism
Not just there but externally
Wait i mixed religions my b
She worked for norton antivirus and apparently interacted with a lot of nuts
Dude my mom was quiet about criticizing them for years and then she got laid off and I heard about its evils a lot more
Like it started as just christianity plus science. Then it became this beast of a cult thats mega fucked
Everyone in my CS classes
Scientology is literally a disturbing-ass cult
I mean you can be brilliant and still be a dipshit in a lot of cases
Scientology is nutty
Would you rather they be scientologists because much of southern Californian moguls are
like the "great men" historical narrative is such horsecock
Im.literally so confused
it's so fuckin bleakly hilarious to me that steve jobs died because he tried homeopathy to cure his cancer and people still think the heads of tech companies are revolutionary geniuses
Who
What a shame
Ms Urdang passed away
I talked to evan the other day
Bill Clinton
Richard Nixon
Tricky Dick Slippery Willy
Who what and who
Every so often Ill have the intrusive thought that Evan Cypher said to Ms Urdang Ill take Tricky Dick and Slippery Willy for 400 during an APUSH jeopardy game about Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton
Speaking of high school
When Steve Jobs died Ill never forget when my friend said everyone but your iPhones on silent to honor him for a moment
If I see AH in all caps it means the auction house in WoW or isaac just saw some fat tiddies
giving you the shit acronym
The ghost of Steve Jobs is haunting your phone
Id be like fuck you
AH
Hey Michael
If my roommate was like
Exactly
I wouldn't even put that together
ah = almost home Thats some good autocorrect
The acronym I never use
Love that thats getting corrected to almost home
***ah yes
And then my friend was like my parents are from Trinidad dont call me African American and then my teacher was like almost home yes but the slave trade
blackness is super complicated in America because the transatlantic slave trade literally disconnected a shitton of people from like, the exact area of Africa they were from which made like... pan-black-ness or whatever it's called a thing
It really depends on what context you're referring to
^
We tend to use black to talk about social status at this point
I remember in high school my teacher refused to say black and would say African American
Subsaharan africa bar special circumstances is better
Delineating as just being from Africa specifically to mean black ignores some context right
Did your parents oppress or were they oppressed
I mean its literally a 50/50
Right I just mean in general
South africa is a big guessie
Barry just dm me your genes
I'd say it largely depends on the context
No one calls Elon Musk African American for being from South Africa
Plus you also got Dominicans
i've always wanted to get a 23andme but i'm not giving a corporation my genes
Yeah
Right but I think it does have connotation to skin tone
Because a black person in Britain is still black
Well just African
I'm pretty sure black means African American
20 going on 21
I've been confused as to wtf I am for years
Yeah
Middle Eastern right
it's ok, the idea of a milkshake pillar is pleasant
They're Egyptian
But they're not white either
Egyptians aren't black
I wanted to say something to the brain chat
Im tired and dumb
Look I dont fucking know
look all i know is that a Shake Spear would hit the spot right now
Were all aware of the (Milk)Shake Spear of days long ago
The historical connotations sorry
Of the Shake Spear
what connotations? i'm lost
eh?
Im well aware of the cultural connotations thank you barold
The first milkshake pillar in America
The Shake Spear
as a team
who wrote under the same pen name
there's a common theory that shakespeare was a name for a group of people
Prove it
Shakespeare was real
Lmaoo what Chris
Lowkey, as we know it today, yes
The term black was created in America
Also the most famous fictional character is Shakespeare
Black is supposed to define skin tone but in America we transformed the meaning to have American slavery connotations
Ummm prob either Mario or superman
BESIDES JESUS FUCKING KILLED ME HOLY SHIT
Besides like Jesus and Santa
Who is the most famous fictional character in the world
In the us this is also different cause the culture is high key "oh shit i look like tjos so im treated like this"
But most people will look at them and not expect them to be black
Like, whos to say an egyptian ISNT black
But like, there are accepted countries i guess? Like subsaharran africa
High key not trynna speak for all black people btw just how ive seen it
Cause middle eastern culture is different
Uhhhh i guess if they experience the culture.... but in general not
are egyptians black
Which has different levels of course, i.e. someone from the south whos black will have a different culture as a whole than someone from detroit than someone from suburbia, but there are overarching themes
Its more used to explain culture at this point than skintone
Cause like, for example im not BLACK but im black
Um, not really?
so like is there a line where it's drawn
So black is anyone with skin tone that is black per se
i see
but what makes them black
Lol no, it quite literally is skin tone
cause you can be black and have roots in jamaica or haiti or something right
like does black == african
this is gonna sound dumb but what is black ppl
i just remembered we lost aleen
This video isn't ironic btw

Friend that used to knock me for being catholic: I mean even though Ive never seen evidence of absolute truth I believe its out there somewhere and its what we should all strive for
Were talking about absolute truths and whatnot
I wish I can bring this chat to the convo Im having
Why did I chose to be in the worst industry possible

Am I in fucking stupid town junction
Capitalism
NYU only expands
is there a physical deflation chat for ppl trying to lose weight
Disgraceful
Me neither what the
I would have killed it from the inside out like a parasite
I was never added to the NSFW chat
Dong  Expand dong
Are there others I am missing
Unless he meant emotional or spiritual
Im just wondering because he said he was expanding other aspects besides mental
Do you wanna make one lol
Is there a physical expansion chat?
Thank you for the help by the way friends 

Don't leave just mute
WAIT
Keep up the good fight friends
Gonna take a break from here to expand other aspects of myself
Yeah
don't let people make you pick up their slack
so im trying to set clear boundaries now
middle man
this is a running trend with me of being the uh
yeah
at that point the agency is on her to be more transparent with her issues with him
just be like "i hear you guy and im sorry about that"
Probably best to leave it be
not know how or why someone would be mad at him...
ryan has a tendency to like
but ryan thinks they are?
they are not
theyre two of my best friends from back home but like
i mean i care a lot about both parties
If it were someone I super care about then I wouldn't give a fuck but in most cases you dont want any smoke
Just hear him out I  suppose
then leave it be
she said dont be a messenger
Because I feel like this is more than just not answering dms at this point
Id just be like ya good bro?
If she says no then your work is done lol
^^
at least ask her to see if it's ok to say that first
If I were him I'd rather know that than be in the dark
IMO you should
no
Did you tell him what she said
Yo commiseration
the question is what the hell do i say here

and ryan just messaged me saying
so now i have that knowledge
and shes basically like "yeah i dont respond cuz he annoys me and spams me and doesnt know how to sort out his own problems so whenever were both sad we just commiserate and nothing gets done"
so today i felt bad and was liek "ill ask her whats up"
so i kinda blew up at him during our convo
so at first im reluctatnt cuz i dont like playing messenger or goin between people
and he goes "i figured id ask you cuz youre really close with her" (i am)
im like uhhh idk maybe shes busy
(friends of mine btw and in the same friend group for context)
ryan messages me sayin "hey whats up with dianna she hasnt responded to anything i said in 3 months"
ok so the people involved are ryan and dianna
go head
can i seek the wisdom of the brain chat
Bless you
But thats because of nier gestalt
Remy and Emil!
I like the name Emil lol
ooooh yea
I think Japanese names have versions
Some hebrew names have alt versions i think
do male/female versions of names really only exist in european culture
Friend over here, level 3

paul ill watch it at 6 in california so i can tell you about it before it comes out
I wake up at 730 usually so im just gonna request a tldr
6 would be out of pocket
That's like barely reasonable
Me-st
7
Is that 6am for you
HELLZ YEAH
Tomorrow 9am sharp east coast
Thats at 6pst/9est right

WRONG CHAT
FUCK
Wrong chat?
GIMME THE CUTE
POKMON
Waiting to meet a hot Polly
But then I met hot versions of the first two and my mentality flipped
I didnt jive with Pauline or Paulina or Polly bc they were used to tease me as a kid
The Blink to George's Equinox
A subsidiary of George
Now that's a name
Oh Georgie
Georgie down the hall in Palladium tore my dorm apart
HOR-he-ann-uh
Jorgiana
The energy is so different
Though I'm not sure if it's a faithful deviant
I think Jorge did it correctly
emily is so good but imagine a kid being named emil
Georgina is a different beast
I dont know if any ending can salvage geor-
It's very case-by-case, I don't like Georgianna in concept but I knew a cute one in high school so it's all gucci
but also there's georgia
georgina is so bad
I like Ellen but apparently that actually has nothing to do with Allen
I dont like how Georgina sounds but that might just be because I dont like George
How do you guys feel about feminine versions of names
what if you changed jobs in medieval times like would you just have a new last name
Or he has an ordinary reign and passes the keys to Henrietta V
By his son
He wakes up at the end of an arduous journey only to learn his name was changed to retroactively be Henry the 2nd
And then Henry the 1st has to try and fix shit while angsting an appropriate amount
And they just let everything go to shit since they figured the lineage was ending
Like some family knew they would only have 5 generations
That could be a fantasy novel premise I think
Rip
Imagine being born as Henry the 1st lol
You need to establish how long your lineage will be in power
Or Henry the third
Is the first Henry named Henry the 2nd
How would that work
If a royal line were to be named after their son
Johnsonfather
shoemaker
yeah i mean the name schumacher is like
oh wait i get it nevermind
erickson
Johnfather
Like imagine if you were named after your son
Thats pretty weird
I think being named by what you produce is super cute in a kids book context but becomes super depressing in a more capitalist lens
MICHAEL KEEPER OF THE BEES
William Shoemaker
Apple trees are named after apples I think
John Smith
ASK MY LAST NAME
ask the honeybee
or is what you produce named after you
whats that, laborer?
imagine being named only by what you produce
Cinnamon comes from cinnamon trees
it was on that day i realized some days id be telling the jokes and somedays the jokes would be me
one time i asked someone out and they said "im busy that day" and i was like "ok cool" and then i got home and realized i never said what day the date would be
whats your origin story
ive found things i value as more important that do not have wiki pages
people wanna knw my origin story
why
tf but like
a lot of them do
yep
i just found out high schools have wikipedia pages
Isnt anything he does essentially natural
Making captain planet homicidal was too natural a progression
https://youtu.be/TwJaELXadKo
https://youtu.be/YcW7ttZfZ8c
Damn
It included a scene of Linkas cousin Boris jumping through a window and dying from a drug overdose.
And one about drugs
Yo there was an episode about HIV
There was a Captain Planet turn based strategy game on Cartoon Network that I liked
On the other hand
And were a bird
Unless they were wearing jean shorts
It just felt jarring, and also I hated his hair
I wouldn't trust someone with a mullet
Not even just that he was blue and green, but he also wears red
I think it was his color scheme
Probably
Me or Julian
That sounds like the beginning of a stand up routine
So if that trend continues basically the people who can afford to survive will hole up, maybe help their friends, but those who cant afford to are dying regardless
I really disliked Captain Planet when I was a kid
Were already seeing people perish in Chicago when it hit -50, specifically the ones who cant afford housing
Or perish
And have to put aside their differences
People would band together
And growing
Nah but if there was a big cataclysmic event that was killing random people
The most well known example is probably like male chicks being killed collectively after being born because they cant lay eggs and it saves time to just focus on the ones that can lay and be eaten
oh yea i'm down to kill them
Specifically the ones blocking legislation that would limit the amount that companies can pollute and overdo their resource collecting
thanosing
We need to kill CERTAIN people
Either way we need to kill people
Actual damage is because humans are so wasteful per capita theres more than enough stuff to accommodate humans but not at the rate we overharvest basically
Overpopulation has also never really been an issue I watched a really good video on it
Overpopulation will be dealt with by the earth itself
So humans could adapt but yeah it might involve having to migrate during certain seasons like birds
But whats happening now is that the extremes are increasing, which hasnt happened before
Prior to this overall levels of climate change were somewhat unified in cyclical, IE in the Ice Age EVERYTHING was colder
While the northern US had homeless people freezing to death in Chicago, Australia hit levels of heat so extreme that horses and bats were just dropping dead
What happened!
Yo did yall see what happened with Australias climate
Yo did you just call vore funny

Im not down for calling vore funny lol


tru
I think animals already deal with that though and it isnt a big deal
Though furry vore is definitely weird to think about, like you'd have hair all up in your mouth and having it slide down your throat? gross
If I could I would've swallowed Paul a long time ago
Vore is funny. It's a funny fetish because you literally cannot act on it
Gay or furry is
Shit you right
Is vore fine
Combining all is like... ew...
Gay, furry, or vore is fine
The soundtrack was amazing too
I played FFXIV:ARR for a month or two after it came out. It was way cool
If Zero can ask for a Hentai shirt Sonicfox can talk about gay furry vore
We should just FFXIV and hope the game devs make us a better world after the apocalypse
Not after sonicfox just made a furryvore reference
Wheres babylon ammiright
Alternatively, can we just.endnof the world this bitch
No furries allowed
line humanity's brains with eyes so we can vote for the green new deal
can the Moon Presence from Bloodborne become real and turn us all into werewolves
Lets be moonmen
I feel like the cycle is that it accelerates migrant crisises while also fucking up the bible belt, causing the bible belt to lash out at migrants cause the gop is really good at marketing fear and so it perpetuates the cycle cause the fear of now outweighs the fear of 10 years from now
Mayocide when
We should kill all men
Like climate change is going to accelerate the migrant crisis and Americans are either perfectly fine with mowing down brown people at the border or unwilling to do anything to stop it
Definitely fucked up
Agreed.
Yeah, but the fucked up thing is that the people who are gonna be cut down are the least responsible for what's going on
im sinji
The human race is incredibly adaptable. We'll survive. Just maimed and cut down im numbers
The best way to describe how we're dealing with climate change is that anime quote: "There is a point where we needed to stop and we have clearly passed it but let's keep going and see what happens"
But at least we have memes before we die
All the old people sending us to ruin will be dead when we reach ruin
like i feel like the earth/humanity will legitimately not live to see most scientific or societal advances that people think about for the future
At this point it's just mitigation of the damage
I mean we're already past multiple "points of no return" when it comes to climate change
like don't we only have 12 years before it's too late to save the earth from climate change or something like that
Northridge  The valley  Where temps get as high as 110
Not even anywhere in socal tho
We're already dead
It snowed in Socal
Not to mention we literally just started a new nuclear arms race with Russia
Yeah but this time there's actual climate science behind it
Theyve been saying that word for word for thousands of years
The human race will not last a hundred years at the rate we're going. If we do, conditions definitely won't be good for video games
It makes me happy to think that the world still has so much room for growth in that regard
Like in a few hundred years
So its kinda breathtaking to imagine how much stuff there could be in the future
If right now there was suddenly one more country outputting games on the level of japan that would be insane and it would only be one country
But I think in the future the world will surely see more stuff from places like China while other parts of the world will also catch up and get going in terms of content production
I think about that when I go to r/news and then r/worldnews
Like outside of standout successes were mostly only aware of movies, games, etc. from the west and japan
Good
Ive been thinking its pretty surprising how not globalized the world is in terms of media
Lol
Why do they get to not
Yeah that confuses me
Why
Arizona doesnt observe daylight savings
Wtf
Im dumb

Omg I just found out daylight savings doesnt last half a year lol
I think its called bench part #2
I think they're called 45lb Olympic bars

everyone thank michael for the first learning hour
Lift Sticks
Bars
what do you call the bars that you bench press
I can present smash
who's gonna do the first learning hour
Considering how nobody uses Skype anymore its amazing its still used as a verb
I feel like I have so much I dont know
I wanna do it too
In this year?
Skype?
I want to Learn
Can I Skype in
Yo actually lets do it
I'm sure yall got stuff in that lot
There's a lot of shit I know nothing about
I'm down
let's do learning hour here
I gotta learn more things
man it feels kinda bad thinking about how few things I could share meaningful knowledge about
Whens smb2 crackin top10
I think if I had to present on the spot right now, Odyssey would probably be at least in the top 10 things I could present on
Omw
Bruh
show them celeste any% sub30
Gonna show em how to run a tournament
He actually just told us they dont necessarily have to be work related
to work
does it have to be a relevant thing
Now most situations in which I would be presenting are ones where I'm interested in what I'm talking about
Every week someone else presents
I didn't think I would have to do them again but my boss started this idea called learning hour where we present something we know well to teach the team about
I used to hate it but that was mostly when I had to present on things like the circulatory system
actually I don't think I care anymore
My aversion to it died down, but that might just be because I don't have to do it much anymore
I hate presenting
It was easier the last presentation because I had more things to talk about and I could actually show things
I'm not graded or anything so I'm trying not to care

It prob went fine
Just finished giving a presentation where I felt like I couldn't convey anything I thought so this hits hard
Its literally telephone
isn't that wild
but really we're always doing our best to translate our thoughts into words that vaguely convey what we want, and then other people have to translate those words into thoughts
Like, being a good is literally such a rare trait and is actually sooo useful
I've never known you to not
it feels more frustrating if you assume that you're thinking in words, and for some reason you can't express those words verbally
Its about the same unless youre a god
Allen you've always found the words
and you could argue the translation is inherently less accurate than translating between languages on Bing or some shit
because she said she has a hard time putting her thoughts into words, which is not only a super common concern, but actually we're always having to translate our thoughts into words, right
I was talking to my sister a little about this yesterday
I don't really enjoy thinking about words too much, because it's similar to how reality starts breaking down when you overthink it, but without the security of even presumably being real
Youre welcome is the same
what is 1 apology really
apologies are also in the same boat as thanks
Like if you say "I apologize," you needed to say it for it to happen
because you would still need to do it
well that's not performative
Ay fuck you
but I think "thank you" also works
Huh
the primary example was when you say "I do"
Like the word presumptuous?
I make drawings
Oh Im already interested
like just by saying it, you do the thing
in one of my classes we talked about words that are performative
bah, thanks
Cause it's so rare
The gratitude of a grumpy person is probably worth more
Different people have different valued appreciation
There are children here
Watch your fucking language
I will surely fall
Michael don't say these sweet nothings to my sensitive insect probulae
So is one thank more like a unit of gratitude
Id give everything to Andy if I could
Thanks
Thank you
Everything to me
because most of the time when you say thank you, you say multiple
Lots to the receiver
Nothing to the giver
is it saying it once
how much is one thank

I'm boutta Thanos a bagel with cream cheese
No
Is that what you think about Chris
Thanosing is giving someone a big purple dick
Its the universe in this example
The bowl is fine
What happens to the bowl
To me thanosing isnt the act of halving or balancing, its an act of destruction Thanos undertook to achieve the goal of halving / balancing
i do imagine you eating half of a whole pizza
In all seriousness Id say 4 slices
Id envision shoving you in a locker you nerd
What do you envision
If I say I thanosed half my pizza
The question is
Id say no
Did I eat half a pizza
If I had 2 slices of a pizza where only 4 are left
Thats like being like
I ate 1/4 of the initial population size and 1/2 of the current population size
So
That was also in Fallns question lol
Did you eat half or 1/4
So if you Thanos half a bowl of m&ms
thanosing one person

True
Living things
Half of them should be gone
He wouldn't want to merk everyone
If i thanos a bowl of m&ms
His motivation was to empty the world bc it was too crowded
Half of things are completely gone
Or rather
It's definitely half
Who is Thanosed
i never heard anyone say thanosed actually
Im fuckin hungry
Hmm
Because the cats died in a mass genocide caused by a single action
Whys that
Then if the cats got thanosed they should all be gone
Someone got thanosed if they died in a mass genocide caused by a single action
But in that case its still the 100% definition
Like to me the definition is
Mass genocide
Ive only heard the word thanosed in the context of like
wait i've never heard anyone say that
They just got destroyed
But they werent even half of anything or a part of anything
Colloquially people say individual things got thanosed if they die or get destroyed or whatever
Also
Also you can halve two people
You can decimate people
it's like saying iron man got decimated
Which I think is way more confusing than if you just say Thanos thanosd half of life
but like individual people don't get thanosed only a group of people
If its half then iron man also got thanosed
Spider-Man got thanosed because he got destroyed in the halfsies
Because if its half the ones that are still there also got thanosed
But there should be no cats anymore
Thats what Fallns question was to begin with
Half the cats
are there no cats anymore or half the cats
ok like what if you thanos all the cats
I would say yes
Like was Spider-Man thanosed
If you use the half definition it doesnt make sense in a lot of contexts but the 100% definition makes sense for everything
i feel like he thanosed the universe
But he completely got rid of the things he actually thanosed
He didnt Thanos the universe, he only thanosed half the living things in it
but also like can you thanos one person or only a group of people
half is like his brand
i feel like someone else probably did that better than him
If you Thanos one person you dont get rid of half
I think its all
it's definitely half
I had an almost heated debate with Falln about whether thanosing something means destroying all or half of it
the rotten fruit would be ripe to it
I wonder which it would go for
If you put a worm in a box with a rotten fruit and a ripe fruit
But idk if they're decomposers by choice
Eating things and the last stage of their cycles
Worms are decomposers
are worms ripe
But a worm just eats
But a monkey will eat a yellow banana when it sees it
Well humans might have the only attention span and memory good enough to understand the different stages
Yeah but is ripeness part of that
That process existed, humans just named it
You can look at a seed, a vine, a bud, a fruit, and a rotten fruit
Cause fruits and vegetables grew on their own
Well humans named the process
Best is a human construct
Like does it exist as beyond when things are best to eat
Isnt most things
Is ripeness a human construct
Class
Where?
I was half paying attention to my surroundings but then everyone stopped at once but I still heard the audio
I just hade a moment of life buffering
Someone bring that Pokmon episode of charmamder and pikachu fighting off the cold
This is some egg vs chicken shit
but he regulates the temperature of his tail
that's why it dies when it goes out
maybe charizard is super cold-blooded and needs to use its tail to heat up
that's the million dollar question
charizard*
yeah but is that charisse's
I thought the idea of "cold-blooded"-ness was that the animal can't regulate their temperature on their own and need to engage in behavior to prevent their bodies from overheating or overcooling? Reptiles often "bask" in the sunlight or burrow underground when they need to warm up or cool down, respectively. Can a biology person weigh in?
:succing:
:sulking:
Pretty even so far

Its over
Same
Fuk

Theres only one thing we can do
Hmmm
And charizard is with flamethrower
No but they arent generating their own heat
Fire isnt the desert but
Are reptiles in the desert warm blooded
https://twitter.com/wowowsla/status/1098003655297511424?s=21
Everyone weigh in
Well if he has cold blood but its perpetually warmed by his own body, wouldnt he just be warm blooded

Unless
but his bloods not on fire
Well charizard is also on fire
Salamanders and chameleons are cold blooded  Charizard is originated from lizards *and* dragons? Or from the relation of dragons to lizards that exist in komodo dragons and the like. Those are cold blooded. The only outlier could be if dragons are warm blooded
They die like despite being warm blooded
but people die in cold
Dying in cold makes you cold blooded
like cold blooded animals die in the cold
does that make you warm or cold blooded tho
He dies in cold

Wait. No
Yes
Is charizard warm blooded
Well maybe not literally but I think the insight I gained from the raw emotional power of that moment can be of storytelling use for sure
Can you incorporate it into one of your projects somehow
Sounds nice tbh
Im afraid I might die with my greatest contribution to the world having been sjfall
Zucc
why doesn't messenger have custom emotes
:wowOwsla:
:sjfall:
He was every other top 8 spot
Bruh
We were just playing for losers top 8 but the only other person I remember in bracket is martial
It gets worse tbh
I probably would've
Thats fucked
Lylat legal in your dreams or you expecting me to take you there
I ban Lylat btw
that sounds so possible
You said yeah basically this caterer is known for having a bad reputation but Allen goes with them every year
Wait what was the issue then
Well it actually was a caterer
Why did I say caterer
The way you worded it made me mad
@Allen I stand by my dream statements.
I probably wont believe you but take me anyway
If that happens someone needs to take me back to Teremok
The only issue is my memories might split if the instability gets worse
Ill try to sort it out
Im trynna die
Im mad now
At least not in a way that you would be aware of
It shouldnt affect you too much
Dont worry
Im so confused
Something must have gone wrong in the past
It seems this timeline is destabilizing faster than expected
Oh no
02/19/2019
19
What year?
*2/19
2/18
Wait whats the date today
Does anyone else see retail space
Like it says retail space available
?
I see retail space
Its Teremok
Wait do you see signage or something

I will when I walk past it again soon
Or if its only manifesting to me
Take a picture of it
Can someone confirm if this restaurant is visible to other people
Like by coincidence
I met one of my friends there once
Did she ment you
You tell me
Is that the mentor
Did you meet the chef yet
Yeah
Did you refuse the call yet
So it might be the end
Well I was a regular before
Go in and begin the hero's journey
But its there
I took a closer look and its like uninhabited
But revisiting the restaurant that reappeared
I dreamed I beat Paul game 1 in bracket with mii brawler and then we went to dinner and he trash talked my choice of caterer
Everything makes sense
I had a dream in which djp was a drummer
yellow cav
it always did
So my suggestion stands
Red infantry green flier yellow cav blue armor
Loool what's it for
Unfortunately Falln said Res(tactic) isnt good fodder, your Canas blows ass and it made me so mad that I memorized it
Thats pretty good
RIG for your Combat Bio Armor
I just like writing in iambic pentameter
I felt like my brain became the iPhone suggested words thing after the first word
I didn't really intend on a self help message but after the first 5 words I chose, I was forced into it
I feel like these answers say a lot about us
Repent! Ignorant goblins, fetch yourselves! Catastrophe betraying aggregates
Rest individually, give for yourself care, break, alacrity
Rick, I Got Fired. Your Car Became Alimony
I got Really indecisive gremlins feed your cats big acorns

Everyone make a mnemonic for this
Enjoy!

I only know the backup
Allen whats the plan
Damn this YouTube ad just asked if vegetarians can eat animal crackers
Chris's back up plan
Whats the best nation (pauses, halfhearted responses from us) a DOnation (holds out cup)
In order to get money
What was that funny thing that bum on the street said to you guys
Let's go 3 day weekends
But not only is it not Sunday, but it's also effectively not even Saturday
I keep thinking it's Sunday
they banned that
can people airdodge
You had me for a second
*black
I thought pokeaim was blank
I think a lot of it would derive from harmless stereotypes
that being said i thought vikki was white for a long time
not even like accents or something i mean
like sometimes i'm watching a smash vod and i think that commentators definitely asian
can you tell someone's race from hearing them talk like i feel like you can but why
I cant account for 1 of those years
yeah link's awakening the original had a shitton of references to other nintendo stuff
allen where have you been for the last 26 years
I refuse to believe that chain chomps are in Zelda and no amount of facts can change my mind
So the door doesnt have a goat
than you actually being correct
even then, I would say he's statistically more likely to be faking you out
So almost regardless of what he says, you should switch, unless he says you're right
alternatively if he says there's fewer than 50, do you switch
is that correct
then you switch
Then you say 83, then Andy says there's more than 50
Like there's 0-100 jelly beans in the jar
this might only be valid if you can't actually see the jelly beans
if each number of jelly bears is a door with a goat
I think you switch
But damn
Theoretically I do
Do I switch
And then you tell me there are more than 50
Change or stay
You win a car
There's 4 rats in this jar
If I guess 83 jelly beans in the jar
The 3 door problem
Wait Andy
maybe 18
a rat wouldn't eat that many jelly beans
83
instead
but with rats
imagine that game where you have to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar
oh my god
Brought to you by an uncertain number of rats in a jar
my two moods
normal vs leptin receptors removed lmfao
Chris are you enjoying this simulacrum

When we live
But what happens
Everyone always asks what happens when we die
we live until we die
Not from the food ofc
there's also ghrelin which is the opposite and makes you hungry according to low blood sugar levels and if you get rid of it in a mouse they just don't eat and die
Dont we all eat until we die
same
I feel like it's an urban legend but some people say rabbits eat until they die if they aren't stopped
poor mousey
and if you get rid of leptin in a mouse they actually just keep eating way past being physically full
spiciness
there's a list of things that release leptin which is what makes you feel full and one of them is physically stretching your stomach but there's also things like acidity and spiciest
But you do feel full after eating a lot of non nutritional food
i think like almost all fullness is chemical and not physical
But its kinda effective
It's just treating the dehydration
If you're really hydrated your body will produce saliva for you
that sounds like it could be of use in a speedrun
wait so if your mouth is good your body thinks it's hydrated?
Without the cramps from the water going through their system
To get the "hydration"
and conversely what if you're really hydrated but your mouth isn't
They swish water in their mouth and spit it out
do you just feel perpetually thirsty or how does that work
That's a trick boxers use
so like your mouth is hydrated
but what if you were drinking water, but it doesn't go past your throat
You feel thirst when you're dehydrated
Because the most obvious way you feel dehydration is in your mouth right
Which would just cause you to bleed out faster
my initial question was how related thirst is to dehydration
Well for the water to get where it needs you'd need to be mad open
like as open as they can be without also killing you
How open
When i get out of the shower or bath i'm mad dehydrated tbh
what if you have open wounds
No you can't
your head is above water
Is your face closed
don't delete this
can you absorb water to live
okay so if you were dying of dehydration, but like in a body of water
That's the 7th saddest thing I've ever heard
I posted it on r/askscience and they deleted it :(
you know I had a really similar question to this before the advent of this chat
Or if you actually need to have nootchies
To see if just filling up your stummy makes you feel full
See how much you can drink before you feel full
why
Drink a ton of undigestable, non toxic liquid
but you can physically feel bloated I think
anyway
brain stuff lol
Like I assume a lot of feeling full is brain stuff
Have you ever drank soylent?
Like half lol
how much of fullness is even physical
yeah so as a corollary
Which send the signals to your brain that you're not as hungry
Your body processes the smaller bits more quickly
idk how to word it
Like if you eat something pureed, does it use your stomach space better than if you ate the same amount but in huge pieces
Idk about form
Composition plays a role
How much does the form of what you eat affect how full you feel
But yeah really great meditation guide Ive been using a lot for a while
Not to mention my man looks like Vincent from smash
But this is like the best relaxation resource Ive ever found
https://youtu.be/NJCUckX9s8M
Idk where else to put this
Ok so
 


Thats something that has no impact on my life and no relevance to my personality I think
My pinky fingers and pinky toes are all bent slightly inwards because of weird genetics
i have 10% str growth
Cause at the time of occurrence they were relevant
See like, using past events is illegal
I cut my face on a fireplace when I was a toddler while I was popping off during hide and seek
Those all seem pretty relevant idk
I heavily dislike the smell of papayas and enjoy the sound of feet tapping on a hard surface
The edges have less filling
Relevance
Oh no
The edges are the best part wym
But I do that to get the annoying part out of the way first and save the best for last, which might still inform aspects of my personality
I eat the edges off Pop Tarts first
Everyone share a fact about yourself that isnt remotely relevant
Like theres so much of each individuals identity that might never be remotely relevant to you or to the world at large but its still part of who they are
Theres something beautiful about it
Thats like in FE when units arent playable but they have growths and shit
Think of all the people who lived their whole lives without ever interacting with things their allergic to
Solidarity
Id have to feel so much retroactive fear
Same here brother
Ive never been stung by a bee so sometimes I wonder what if Im like deathly allergic
Yes

Is it intentional parallelism to have dog bite / whiskers on kittens and bee sting / raindrops on roses
Being stung by a bee can be more serious on average
Idk if thinking about raindrops on roses can reasonably ameliorate that
Getting bitten by a dog can be pretty serious
Ive been thinking
I felt it in my heart
I cant find a gif of Broly nodding from the end of the movie but if I could Id do it here
So thanks yall
Mainly cuz I felt very out of my league today and very disconnected in general from people lately
Ngl Im tearing up
I'm so glad you're Michael
Im so glad youre in this chat Michael
So I feel real good and happy and like valued I guess
Also I was talking with him about how what the dude was writing applies to game studies and games and al that jazz and at one point he said as an aside like wow, Im so glad youre in this class Michael
So Im not completely dumb
Apparently everyone in that class hardcore struggled with what were reading including the profiessor
Im alive
Like, I love Migi because of his alien characteristics
Like probably higher than what I could imagine
Part of why I love Parasyte a lot is because it imagines an extremely type of lifeform that views the world far more differently than humans
Average emotional strength is probably really high
Well imo most people have strong enough feelings that they could believe theirs are the strongest, so that gives me perspective
Cause I know the extent
That helps me empathize more
I know my feelings are stronger than anyone else's
But at the same time, thinking that thats probably not the case helps me empathize with people more
Or at least, I feel that temptation
Its kinda tempting to think that your feelings are stronger than other peoples
Because you can get a sense of how much people express how they feel, but thats also really variable from person to person
Its hard to tell with feelings
Kind of like the color thing
Its impossible to know
Like when I feel happy or sad, is it about as strong as most other people, or stronger, or weaker
Sometimes I wonder about the strength of individuals emotions
And then later that robot waves at walle again!! 
https://youtu.be/QoV9nHEJ6m4
If only I could emote that well
So the fact that they're able to emote so well makes them so much more expressive cause they're breaking the limit
It can come from similarity, or just metaphoric literal proximity
Although robot characters are arguably even more limited in expression
I guess it depends on what you consider to be closeness
Their expression isn't limited to the human form
I wonder to what extent its even possible to relate to something outside of humanity, or whether thats ultimately an illusion
So its interesting to me when people feel like they relate to certain nonhumans, because theres a chance its because of their humanity
I think in many cases non-human characters can most obviously showcase human feelings because the contrast with their nonhuman form is more clear while when you look at people, humanity gets muddled up with the shells that contain it
My brain is fried
I tried reading the shit again and thought I got it but I tried explaining it and I straight up dont
Michael kept me alive today
This is all thats keeping me alive rn
https://youtu.be/XPHrBxCQ5fc
Thao blow my brain off
holy shit a manifesto???? that's a top 1% intense word
Michael set his own nickname to John Spaghetti.
Bars
Im reading this shit and have to take a shit and listening to the hell combination get me out
Parappa the Rapper and AC/DC are playing at the exact same time and I wouldnt wish this torture on my worst enemy
I said this in other chat but
Because there are evident ties there and interesting connections to interrogate and its like a little frustrating how often I find science and the arts being seen as two different buildings but hey
Its weird that he prefaced that hes literally going to ignore how this pertains to education and science
This guy was a Leninist (or at least Marxist) And is more looking at the idea you mentioned in the context of arts and culture
Yeah its definitely relevant
I often see this paragraph brought up with regards to Martin Luther King Jr. and it makes a lot of sense
btw, the stuff you mentioned from the thing you read might be straight out of lenin. here's a similar thing he said in one of his works:  "What is now happening to Marxs theory has, in the course of history, happened repeatedly to the theories of revolutionary thinkers and leaders of oppressed classes fighting for emancipation. During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the consolation of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it."
I just talked to Brendan about the manifesto Im reading and apparently its important if not a little condescending so Ill grin and bear it
ITS REAL
WORD

Welcome to brain expansion, the philosophy/deep shit chat
It That Gets Left Hanging added Michael Dellapi to the group.
(I kid, it's just funny that I don't remember something that has to do with an illness that makes you forget things)
So the door to the laundry room in my building is a little weird and I developed a mental habit where I always think it opens the opposite way of what it looks like and Ive never gotten it wrong with this method
Guys I might have Alzheimer's
Its why you dont see a lot of prevalent people get Alzheimer's
Yeah I don't remember
Its significant if im not mistaken
I hope my laundry door single handedly prevents my Alzheimers
Its like, 25% less likely right?
When it comes to "DO THIS TO NOT GET CANCER!!!" stuff I'm always skeptical
I mean I don't know how much it prevents Alzheimer's but the logic checked out when I read it
Oh okay Ill just keep doing it then lol
It prevents Alzheimer's
I mean I guess theres no reason I wouldnt be able to
Staying mentally active is good though
So I wonder if I could change my mental process to just remembering the way it opens
But it makes me do mental work every time because I need to quickly think about which way Id think it would open and then do the opposite
So the door to the laundry room in my building is a little weird and I developed a mental habit where I always think it opens the opposite way of what it looks like and Ive never gotten it wrong with this method
It really all depends on what you want out of the game
Individuality matters a ton to me but that's just me
Only in New York could you have this Greninja problem haha
I have the same feelings, but then I remember that Bowser loves me unconditionally and I stay faithful to him
I only think that way about my own characters, and I know I shouldn't think even that
I know youre kidding but I mean neither are discount venia
I wouldn't necesarily call Parecki discount Andy
Ok about gren and not being a discount venia: Counterpoint: Andy and Parecki
But you're my wife
I meant it unplatonically
=allen hates me
"Fuk gren tbh"
"Your core is being a Greninja main"
Why cant my side b be invisible
Fuckyou
WAIT WTF ALLEN
Wait wtf Chris
Fuk gren tbh
Just not to main lolol
I think gren is cool
Although I guess I wouldn't care as much if I just liked the character
I can't help but feel like, what's the point of being a NY Greninja who isn't Venia
Greninja is a good example even though I don't really play him anyway
But I also know that isn't a great mindset either
Im not putting effort into gren because of venia
I hate picking characters in which I have to play the ditto often lol
I guess the more common your character is, the more likely it is that you would be a discount version of someone else lol
but that said
I wish I could have expressed that with fewer negatives
For me it doesn't bother me if my character is common, but it does bother me if it's a character where I don't think I can realistically not be a discount version of another player in the region
And now it is too ingrained to not like it
Chris?
I like it because my friends played it
I feel like it's hard to express myself gameplay wise so that's what I boil down to
For me I gotta love the aesthetics and they gotta be unique
Im put off Wolf because so many people play him even though I was so hype for him, which is irrational on my part
In Smash yeah thats me
To go back to the Smash context I think a lot of people do try to play characters because they're more uncommon / unique
Polyamory 
I'll flower you one day
I'm sorry
Canas
If Im less into something because I know I would have been more into the other person, its not fair to either of them
Regarding dating? Absolutely
Would you go with who makes you happier?
Ive been in situations like that and its very rare that two different people make you feel equally happy I think
Full disclosure this came from thinking about Canas and Sophia
What I was initially wondering today was if you're in like a Betty and Veronica situation, if there's 2 people you would be happy with, but 1 of them has fewer romantic prospects for whatever reason, should you or would you try to get with that person
It's one of those things where it can be hard to realize that you think you're taking the higher moral ground but you're possibly just being lazy about exercising judgment
I used to be able to garner happiness from being a people pleaser before I realized that the approval of people you're actively trying to impress is almost pointless
It's difficult
Growing up, for a long time I just thought the best approach was to lean as heavily toward looking out for others as you possibly could, but now I think I realize that's not necessarily ideal for other people, let alone yourself
Having an active conversation with someone you're not particularly fond of for instance
It comes up in a ton of smaller interactions
I feel like in general, finding the balance between looking out for others and doing what you like is one that's difficult
How often can I spend quality time with my friend in the future
A lot of it depends on the future too
Like you could easily be in a situation where you need to pick between your actual friend, and someone you aren't really friends with
Yeah exactly. It's so multidimensional, and it also depends if my friend is the type to mind, what the event is...in general though I say an invite means so much that it's worth passing to someone if you know they don't get many
Past a certain threshold of how close you are to the two people relatively, then you could be going too far for the sake of including them
Like Zay mained Wolf because he loves Wolf
Some people just love the characters aesthetics or history and that's it
I think this is tough to translate into Smash haha there's so many small reasons why someone would main a character
Yeah I think that's what makes it complicated
I'm all for making people happier but I gotta consider myself too
Like what if you would rather main Wolf, but nobody else is going to main Zelda if you don't
Also who I enjoy more
I think it depends on how happy it'd make them
I think this could come up across a lot of different contexts
To what extent should popularity be a factor if you have to choose between two things or people, like if you could only take one friend to an event, would you take your super close friend or your friend who you're less close to but is less likely to get invited otherwise

Watched Enter the Dragon with Rahul today
This dude tho? He cool

Man I used to think Anonymous was cool
Whutta buncha edgelords

This was more or less just a day in Carnages life

Like
There are so many people like Carnage who get arrested and break out of jail a bunch of times and then they work their way up to increasingly weirder shit like cycling through dying, getting absorbed and coming back to life, all between / while fighting The Thing and the silver surfer
Lol I love reading up about comics characters
I like how Wikipedia just says yeah it somehow happened
Is this bad physics

Yo wtf
Carnage is basically "Dark Venom"
Imagine Yami Venom
Or Shinichi and Migi
He's like Yugi and Yami Yugi, they're a team
I thought seeing Spider-Man and Captain America in a fighting game was amazing
Do we count Venom as a human or monster character
Venom is goop and I love him
As a kid I used to play Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 on cabinet a lot and my team basically always had Venom and Strider on it because they're cool as fuck
Lol

Anyone remember the Enforcers
Because his comics design is really dumb
I liked Rhino and Lizard a lot and would be really curious how the MCU designs Rhino
I dont usually like the animal villains but I did for Spider Man
Then I saw Carnage 
When I was a kid I saw Venom and he was like the coolest thing I could imagine
Oh I guess they already did Lizard too
Very much no hes always been a huge thing
Is carnage only in Ultimate
To me the most notable are green goblin venom and doc ock, then maybe sandman I guess
I like his aviator helmet and fur collar huge design improvement
Yeah Michael Keaton did him well
Because he was like an old guy in a bird suit
or rather sandman than the vulture
can you really say you know more about the vulture than sandman
I remember thinking he was weird when I read the amazing Spider-Man
Never a world ending threat but hes always there
Part of the Sinister Six
yeah for sure
Hes pretty notable
And small scale villains are good for the friendly neighborhood theme
Is Vulture really notable
doc oc and sandman were already done
I thought Vulture was executed amazingly
those are the most notable spiderman villains
who would be next in line?
Like why electro, and why did MCU Spider-Man open with Vulture wtf
random?
But half the time they bring in the most random person from his rogues gallery
I get that he cant be fighting green goblin in every movie
they dont even give explanations in ironman
Going back to Spider-Man for a second
Even if the technical dialogue in Iron Man is bullshit and I look it up later if Im fooled during the movie it succeeded
I think a successful fake explanation will extend your suspension of disbelief
but they tried to base it on actual science
And I think thats fine as long as it isnt internally inconsistent
like peter could have easily invented an ex machinaguffin to solve the problem
Well in some situations though, they basically have to give it some kind of explanation, but any explanation they give is going to be inaccurate because the thing itself is just not possible
But I v much dont like when people use bad physics as a reason to dislike the movie
but saying electromagnets hold a charge is something you learn in eigth grade is kinda a stretch
Yeah I like a good feasible explanation
and thats a pretty feasible explanation using the fictional ideas and physics
but then they explained that its using your chi to lift yourself
noone really thought about it
in dragonball the characters can fly
but if the explanation is bad we have a problem tbh
physics being bad is the goodest thing
But its strange to me when people say that movie physics being bad / wrong is a bad thing
but theres a difference between now you see me and the prestige
I had a book that just talked about stuff like how if Superman really caught Lois shed die or catch on fire and stuff
to a point but yeah lol
I do think that talking about movie physics is interesting
like electro can do all the crazy shit he does because its a super hero movie
Do they legitimately want Spider-Man to be scientifically accurate
well to be fair he did say that the movie is allowed to do stuff thats cool
Like
I dont understand what these people who fuss over movie physics are trying to accomplish
https://www.wired.com/2014/10/bad-physics-amazing-spider-man-2/
Not that he has real web, and its also marvel but lol
He has a villain named Electro
But like, this has to have come up in Spider-Man right
naturally, spider silk is nonconductive
Spiders? People who want the webs to be conductive? Spider-Man?
Who is they
I'm getting mixed results from Google. Some pages say yes, some say no, some say yes but because they slather conductive stuff on the webs
wait nvm
yes
Do spider webs conduct electricity
Most people are younger than their names
Like what would you be trying to build

Bicycles could have been named first
Most things were created before they were named
But for a lot of tech stuff, like maybe virtual reality, Id say the thing itself happened considerably after the name
Comedies are older than their name, right, because genres / labels come into existence to describe things that are already there
So like
I'd say older cause it's not their game until they're given it
Are most things older than their names, or younger
Cloud ruins everything
They just have to get out of cloud
Itll probably be broken soon because of seaside clip
WR is at 1:00:22
So if someone gets a god run sub hour is possible
And individual runners SoBs are around 59:40 now
Thats a lot of room for improvement
Wait thats insane
If you just put together the fastest kingdom times from everyone I think it could be a low 59
Which is at around 58:10
So the community has a BTT time that puts together the fastest clip of every segment of the run
Yeah not TAS
Like the best possible time a person could get?
How fast is the realizable route
Yeah 5 seconds is huge at this point
Wait thats good
And is easier than old route
It saves 5 seconds
But everyone is stuck at cloud
I would need to see it
It goes oob to get one moon and then go into the sphinx loading zone
Does it involve the Sphinx
It uses cheep cheep
Theres a seaside clip now
Thats ugly why
Lol
@Chris the seaside reroute gets the sphinx moon
I wouldn't mind being a pyramid
I wouldnt mind being a sphinx
You are now the goat sphinx
Congratulations
Im picking the door that isnt guarded by a sphinx
They state that only one tells the truth and only one tells lies
In order to get past them they ask you to solve their riddle
As you come to the end of monty's hall you are stopped by 2 sphinxes
But the present never stops
Total time
Ooh yeah
So you could argue that time stops at the present
To like someone who died
I think when people say all time they always mean up until now
Goat is probably most appropriately a retroactively given title
Yes
Nah
Well do you have to be better than people in the future to be the goat
Theoretically yes, practically no
So no
Time doesn't exist
Does time that hasnt happened yet exist
Goat oat at T
Allen is the G.O.A.T.
As in switched into it
I am the goat
You chose the goat lol
No you didn't
I got the goat at least once
He played three times
Wanna play again?
You got the car too tho
Allen is just lucky
That's literally it
Yeah
Not switching wins you 33.33%
Switching wins you 50%
Its random lol
So like, running it in python doesn't really tell you much
Cause they could pick the car the first time
Well see it's not like the monty hall theory always works
It would be faster
Switching is always better
I can run this in python lol
Its solved
You got the car
Congratulations
Switch to 3
Door 2 has a goat would you like to switch
Switch to 4
Would you like to switch
Okay door 1 has a goat
2
1,2,3 4
Yes
Allen pick
Let's see
If they get rid of 3 do you go to 1
And you switch to 2
Allen pick
You pick 1 and they get rid of 4
What a terrible room
Allen pick a number 1,2,3,4
Okay what if theres 4 doors
And when they dont switch on the final case I get even madder
When people are above the expected value from the start and keep going I get so mad
Except it has an expected value that you can always take
Deal or no deal has this problem mad times
And even though you have a 1/3rd chance to do that it's still super rare for no reason
But once i tried it on someone and they picked the car the first time
I think I remember people said it makes more sense if you pretend theres more goats and doors
I'm not even bullshitting btw you guys actually picked the right door
They were both cloned from monty's original goat
Ill take goat 3
It was cloned
Probably not
Yo Monty's Hall would be a cool reference dungeon in a game
Was it a better goat than goat 3
A goat
Wait what did door 2 have
If the host shows you where the car is, should you switch
You've mastered monty's hall
Door 1 has the car
Congratulations
Im switching
Would you like to switch or stay
Which one is telling the truth
Door 3 has a goat
That one has the goat
Chris no
I pick 2
Chris has also solved the monty hall problem
1,2,3 or what
Chris pick a number 1,2,3
I dont know what I mean, or meant
Ooh i thought you meant it was the same exact probability as the original
The goat wasnt there the first time
A lot of channels have endslates
Cause you could have picked that goat the first time
No it changes
Then nothing changes right
And the host says by the way heres a third door with a goat
But that one has a specific outro
If theres 2 doors and you pick one
Yo it's interesting how so many channels have intros
It was my favorite channel
I watched game theory before fnaf
I extended the wrong letter
Plz surbsrib
Thanks for watching
GAAAAAAME THEEEEORY
Chris?
A GAMEEEEEEE THEORY
BUT THATS JUST A THEORY
You would have gotten the car
And if you switched as the monty hall problem says
Btw door number 3 had the car
You understand the monty hall problem now
Thanks
There you solved it
2
Would you like to change numbers
Okay door number 2 has a goat behind it
1
But I just dont get it
And I think thao also explained it to me
Pick a number 1, 2, 3
I looked at a lot of explanations
Thats how much I dont understand it
Whoops I mean Monty hall lol
You mean Monty hall?
I still dont understand the Monty python problem after all this time
Wheres expand dong when you need it
Same let's expand all aspects of ourselves here, not just our brains
I like this chat a lot and want to help keep it a good environment for talking about shit
And Ill adjust
*call me out
Cool but feel free to call me if I am
You've never been combative in this chat or any other iirc
Ive spent a lot of my life being super passive and not speaking up and I made a personal resolution to speak up more when I think things are wrong
This is outta the blue but I want to issue a general apology if Ive ever gotten combative when arguing online, especially in this chat
oh yea
so it's like the game -> the manga -> the anime -> the card game -> the game
Well theres Cipher cards of feh people
oh yeah the trading card definitely comes from the anime cause there's cards of like professor oak right?
Pokemon the trading card game for game boy color
does anything branch from that
Well the movie is based on the anime right
There's an actual real life pokemon center
From one point?
Was pokemon just an explosion
Digimon might have potential since I think it was a toy first?
But not everything is based on a previous step
It is literally everything
Cause pokemon probably wins
Does pokemon not count
Oh Harley Quinn is pretty good
They were characters from existing comics
I know Robin and Beast Boy are spinoffs of Batman and Doom Patrol but aren't the rest originals?
Spinoff of what specifically though?
And there are teen titans games
Teen titans is also a spinoff
Wait, does this one work? Teen Titans comic -> Teen Titans (2003) -> Teen Titans Go -> Teen Titans Go To The Movies
And then they made suicide squad which is based on a comic and then made more cartoons based on that and the comics
Cause after she was in the animated series they started making comics about her
Does that remove a step or add a step
So harley Quinn was a character that was invented for the batman cartoon

For sure
Is Netflix adaptation a legitimate step
That's what we're here for babe
I kinda regret starting a discussion where the answer might be between FGO and LEGO Harry Potter Years 5-7
For certain characters yeah lol
if yes we may have a contender
can you use history to start fgo
wait
Since theres like legitimately the movie of the book of the historical event
Real life can be a medium I guess, but it probably has to be the first step
It probably doesnt count as a step though
There has to be right
Do you guys think theres porn of LEGO Harry Potter Years 5-7
Hentai
So theres like books, comics, games, movies, TV shows, plays
And then think about whether bigger chains exist than Harry Potter
Okay lets establish possible mediums
The only thing I can think of is Street Fighter -> Street fighter the movie -> street fighter the movie: the game   Now if you wanted to make a movie about that game
Because if you get into like the screenshot of the photo of the merch its messy territory
Well maybe not
Anything can count as long as the next step is based on that thing
Like a tshirt based off the game
Do you count merch
But its debatable
There might be an extra toys between movie and game
Wait
Toys -> movie -> game
LEGO movie only gets to 3 I think
There are very few movies that also have games so it's hard
I forgot books were real
What
Right right right
Ooh the books
ALLEN WHAT
What about the Lego movie
Also Star Wars is a movie to begin with
But it was just an example
Well you could say it for like lotr too
Marvel, dc, Disney,  star wars, etc
Also why are you only saying harry potter
Legos
Toys?
Whats the biggest chain of something like that
You guys know how theres like a game of the toys of the movie of Harry Potter
Yeah
It was the same exact restaurant?
Or if I was in the future before
I wasnt sure if I actually emerged in the past
Today I came out of the subway station and it was back in the same spot
But at some point last years it closed and got replaced with something else
There was a Russian restaurant near my office I went to for lunch sometimes
Or glide your foot on the sheet
Just smack your face on the music sheet
And how awkward Braille sheet music would be
I was talking to @Chris about how you can conceivably read Braille with any part of your body
Oops yeah probably
ASL is American Sign Language so I assume theres others
Isn't it universal
Anyone know what non English sign language or braille looks like
This is like number 8 on the list of names for my restaurant

I got 3 free dog walks today

I can't eat ice cream and do work but I can eat ice cream and get over a girl at the same time
But a responsibility needs to be confronted eventually
Because I know it just has to pass
Hmm a feeling isn't as bad
How different is it if youre trying to avoid a feeling instead of a more concrete responsibility / thing you should be doing
I feel pathetic trying to avoid it
Yeah that makes sense
It depends on the situation but say if something I need to do or say is stressing me
Yeah
Like if youre consciously gaming or something to feel better?
That happens to me a lot with a lot of forms of escapism
Eating is a really primal state I think
It's not the food but the fact that you're aware that it's just food and that the situation still persists
I guess sometimes eating makes me feel better, especially if feeling bad is potentially related to not eating, but usually I think it amplifies
Was it the last one
I finally collected the mad bunny badge
mantling
Thats maddening
I can't eat mad
Eating mad makes me more mad
When you're happy everything is nicer
But like if youre happy isnt eating nice
Yeah thats what Im saying
That paradox ya know
I eat when i'm sad and i'm sad cause i eat too much
I feel like it's a problem with overweight people
Like I havent really tried it much but I did once and I think it made me hyper aware that I was sad
It's a loop
But I feel like that can amplify the sadness
I do that
Well I ask because supposedly people eat ice cream to cheer up when theyre sad
Do you mean like make you feel a stronger version of the mood you were feeling
But when you say amplify
Eating candy will always make me happy
Well what youre eating also partially depends on your mood sometimes
Depends on what i'm eating but yeah usually
Does eating usually amplify your mood
I checked and 46 is apple juice so I feel pretty ashamed of being afraid of accidentally getting that instead of a soda
Its interesting that the internet came into existence around the same time that modern China opened its doors to the west because I think theyre both huge contributors to globalization and they kind of independently happened together
And it always works the second time but I just have this terrible fear that one day its gonna start accepting my input halfway through the first entry and give me 46
Anyway I usually input 64 to get a Coke from the vending machine but even when I wait sometimes my input doesnt register so I have to do it again
Id say the world is just about still fragmented enough that Western history has legs but its on its way out probably
And along those lines I think its only really in the last century that you need to bring up the wider world when looking at the history of any particular country and there are still many places that globalization has yet to really reach
Theres nothing stopping you from talking about say, the history of England in the 1500s but you can only get so far without bringing in a lot of context from broader European history, so in that way purely English history is arguably not a thing
But what I mean is like
My understanding of world history is also pretty ignorant
Idk there were already 2 world wars before that, but I feel that globalization didnt really go ham until around the 80s-90s
Well I think even until around 40 years ago you could look at and talk about western history reasonably but a lot has changed recently
Yeah it might already be unsustainable, but in the phase where theres enough to sustain for the time being
It's already unsustainable. "Whiteness"/"The West" is such a nebulous concept with how many use it today
Like if another planet was colonized, western history might be not a thing at or before that point
In the near future it might become too arbitrarily hard to talk about it in an isolated enough way
Also the concept of western history itself might not be sustainable
I think that was pm
I cant wait for the platinum age of brawl
Historic.
Lol the fall of the five gods started with Armada losing to Swedish

Its also crazy that the history of melee has eras on a level similar to actual history, and like mostly unironically
Its operating on the scale of antiquity / Middle Ages / modern thats really awkward
The classification is pretty easy if you name smaller sections of time
How many posts before we get to futurism
Post post modern
The juvenile ages
They can call it the intermediate ages or something to show it connects the classical period to current modern times
But like, on the scale of a few centuries I guess
Imo the Middle Ages doesnt have long left as a phrase
I remember the first time I saw Blaziken on TV and one of my first thoughts was that it needed to be in Smash
Thats what they said about Luffy and now hes worth like 1 billion beli
Apparently it can stretch them  to punch but I cant imagine those dingly dangly things getting any momentum
What?
Its arms are so weird
I love Breloom so much I wish I could become one
humanity probably won't survive until the middle ages aren't in the middle cause the earth will be dead
Is pure grass op or just boring
But I guess either I just never paid attention to Bulbasaur, forgot at some point, or this has all been an elaborate coverup
I had a good amount of Pokmon content / info too actually
I had that Pokmon handbook thing as a kid
But I always knew it was a thing
And somehow I went until like 2016 before finding out
I agree that having a dual type starter made me mad
Also I might have never picked bulbasaur
I think they realized it was a terrible move and forgot to keep giving it to things because it got powercrept so hard
Because that just seemed like how it should be
It was so unquestionable that the first 3 starter Pokmon were single type at least in their first form
Lmao the vast majority of Pokmon that can learn poison powder are gen 1
But in my mind
I always knew it had poison moves
Wow when was the last time I thought about the move poison powder
Didnt it get poison powder
Im not saying that isnt toxic but like that move wasnt on the game boy
Have you seen ivy dair
Like I still dont fully believe that
The first was when I found out bulbasaur was always part poison type
This is the second most shocked Ive been within recent memory
Black People Are Allowed Now 60s
What version did we get
My mind is actually blown
The swinging sixties were in the U.K.
Wtf
Every time im sad
Everytime i open the chat im sad
~I was in a very famous TV show~
Excuse me  Im sure back in the 20s
Isnt it the swinging 60s
Im sure yeah
Im sure in the 1920s they talked about the 1880s as the 80s
*there
Like is they a Horny 50s
Thats what im saying lol
Are there any other periods in history prior to the 1900s were we say the date
Apparently saves it
That doesnt sound like an 100yr old
Like   Apparently back in the 20s
Yeah so Im saying like, the people we hear usually werent alive then, so its rarer to hear just the 20s
You could phrase it as a historical discovery tho
But by adding roaring it becomes an era that has an understood context you dont need to have been through
I feel like if someone said something like back in the 20s it sounds like they were alive at the time
Well I guess the 20s are long enough ago that we dont hear people say back in the 20s this happened
Rawr
I'm in my the 20s
Like Im SURE its happened to me but I cant remember it
I cant think of a single time someone has said the 20s actually
Thats true but I feel like I hear The Roaring 20s significantly more than The 20s
Also why does the roaring 20s sound so cool
I mean so were 20s before it 
But the 20s was a thing that was actually said with a specific context that will be lost
Unless there is another roar
Exactly
I think the 20s will just be referred to as the Roaring 20s from here out
Do you expect society to roar again
Because its not really applicable to the 10s so it didnt come up yet
Isnt that odd
The 20s / roaring 20s will be dead phrases soon
On a smaller scale
One day all of this will be antiquity
And like, moreso than in the way in which nothing can survive forever
Isnt it weird knowing that the term Middle Ages cant survive indefinitely
How do they handle it in that civ 5 space expansion no one liked
Eh maybe colonizing another planet can start a new era
Tbh I really wanna say we should be in a new age now with the internet, but I think people in 800 probably thought they should be in a different age from 700
Or like until an alien invasion
We can't possibly know until we're way past it
But thats gonna sound dumb when people say yeah the Middle Ages were from 400-1500 CE and the modern era was from 1500 CE to like 6000 ZP
Unless we just stay in the modern era forever
The introduction of the 4th division is going to mess everything except antiquity up
Even in that case the Middle Ages wont hold up because it wont be in the middle anymore
We won't get there :(
When we get to say, 2700, will 1500-2500 be renamed, and 2500-present becomes the modern period?
But like, at what point will that have to change
Im curious because Wikipedia says western history is traditionally divided into classical antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the modern era
Same goes for Malcolm in the
Bold of The Middle to debut so late
Like its only been half the length of the Middle Ages since the middle ages
Did you guys know the Middle Ages lasted over 1000 years
Retweet
I use a vending machine at work sometimes
I thought there were silhouette people as part of the art



And will continue to be
But Ill always see everyone in this chat as the stars they once were
But in reality they probably look really different
So the thing we have to do is develop warp technology, go far enough away from earth, and use a high power microscope to catch the light of the earth from billions of years ago
And I feel weird that like in my head this picture is who they are
A lot of peoples work photos / professional profile pictures are like 10 years old
You guys know how we see stars as they were like a thousand years ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE3x1uS781s
No
was it papes
That looked difficult
*Mario maker level
You guys ever see that ceave gaming video of the worst Mario maker
both
Is that difficult or just bad design
It could happen at the very beginning, or it could literally never happen
Like, what if there was a boss who had a random chance to just immediately kill you without you being able to block it
Like, for something to be difficult, doesn't it have to be able to be overcome through skill?
Outside if the game design philosophy
It's not fair and idt difficulty has to be fair
Yeah that's difficult
It's purely chance
You have zero agency
It's hard but unfair
You have very little agency
If you're in a game and there are 3 doors in front of you, and going through 2 of them kill you, is that technically hard
For something to be difficult, does it have to be fair
Mega Gazunt
Gazuntite
The catalyst of mega expansion
Oh shit Chris
Both day and night dont work
Wait Good day means bye
MeGa
Did someone said
An exemplary example of brain expansion
Allen, Chris, that exchange was the best thing in this chat so far
Good morning means hello
Good afternoon means hello
I think good ____ is hello, except good night is more like have a good night
Good evening means hello
Good night means good bye

I think we reached our destination
Its hard but I got it
Okay
and take away the HP part
okay hold that image
Actually I can
Thats like a weird indie game
an HP jar if you will
Also I cant
Like I dream in video games
now imagine the hp bar is represented as jars
It makes me sad how I can only relate to video games
Okay I getcha
but you can probably tell whether you're at 0/10 or 10/20 hp
but you could also just be at 0/10
If one person is at 10/10 and the other person is at 10/20 the second person feels worse because he's aware of more that he doesn't know
Okay
okay imagine 2 HP bars
Im not that creative
you're an expert
You lost me
imagine 2 jars
I think it's like
Like am I an expert on my test because I dont know the answers
How would you know whether you are an expert or just dont know something at all
You know that thing where people who are experts at a subject think they know nothing about it
or was that the point all along
wouldn't you just get the same result
Running a tape back
It could also maybe have to do with like
Well a running back doesn't replay things necessarily
because you would have to go back to where you were
is it football
but what sport
Maybe it's a sports thing
is it from something where you have to run back to somewhere to try again or what
what does running it back literally mean

Thank you Andy, very cool!
Death is funny huh
Have fun with your fathoms!
Thanks, Andy!
You'd probably be dead after like 40 minutes
You'll feel pretty numb really
And your ears would hurt pretty bad
You'd lose a good amount of sense of feeling

And then start to feel warm
You'd get hypothermia after 5 minutes
I honestly dont know if I can fathom -44 degrees
And we don't deserve this but they are far less deserving of their conundrum
They don't deserve that
I cant believe its this cold and still 50 degrees warmer than what the Midwest reached
I cant let this review win
Google needs to rotate its top reviews before I lose my mind
Ahhh
Is it going to outlive me
How can such a short review command so much power
And why
And in contrast its taken up so much of my attention, seconds at a time over the course of years
Like she was probably done thinking about it before she even finished writing it
And I thought about how whoever wrote this review was presumably not very invested in it
That this 1 review would confront me again and again without fail
But gradually it began to gnaw at me
I didnt really notice it for the first few years probably because its so generic

And over the years, basically almost every time I see this review
I google the union square regal theater regularly when I want to check what its showing

I would put him in my lap and he crawled around my pants and nestled into the bunches of my shirt
Maybe he was panicking yeah
We think he was sick cause he was having trouble breathing
Leon was a very pleasant hamster
Like he panicked and all he could think to do was limp toward his owner
@Andy do you think thats what Leon thought
Would also use my stamina in Feh if I had time afterward
Well you could do other things, but I guess I thought of it as youre about to die and you maybe have time to talk to one person
But it was interesting that Id probably panic and want to talk to her, because its kind of the most obvious course of action
Like I dont have a bad relationship with her
Which is kind of surprising to me
And I realized I would probably try to talk to my mom
Sometimes I also think about what I would do if my life was about to end
Its like you gotta be able to accept losing / death, but only when you have to
And life and death is like that
But I think when youre in the moment, you kind of have to play as if thats out of the question
Because Im totally okay with losing
Actually I think this is really similar to how I feel when Im playing smash seriously lol
Lol distract your primal level
The most primal experience possible
And its interesting to me
Have ice cream or food in your hand as you jump off a building
Like I guess you could just say its your survival instinct or whatever aspect of your being is inherently opposed to dying
But despite these considerations I know that if I was possibly going to die I dont think I could accept it, on like a physical / primal level
And there is a lot of stuff I want to do and peoples lives that I want to be a part of, but Im satisfied enough with my life that if I were to die I wouldnt feel absolutely gutted about the things I hadnt done
I just wanna have a kid or 2 then I'll live completely on the edge
And pain could be really bad, but possibly short
Yeah cause that's just like sleeping forever
Like I wouldnt say I fear the afterlife, or nothingness
And I sort of flashback my life and appreciate it cause passing calmly is ideal
Because I think that in a lot of ways, Im not afraid, but it only takes one way to be afraid, if that makes sense
I've had such precariously intimate moments with lady death that I can do this thing where regardless of how i'm feeling, if like the train stops or something happens where death could be imminent, I can make myself settle into a very calm state of acceptance
I think part of the scariness is that the fear of death seems so primal / fundamental to me
One of the common questions people answer to fill out their okc profile is are you afraid of death and I see a lot of "no" answers
But I know if my life was in danger the fear would be overwhelming
I mean I wish I could say that Im not afraid because I think I do accept that its part of life and all that
I really dont know what to think about it
But the concept also seems like more than I can comprehend
I feel like Im probably not more afraid of dying than an average person
Death is actually so terrifying
Yeah it made me who I am today
Allen this would fuck me up
What the fuuuck
And the whole story was called how could you?
And then they had a baby and the dog was getting old so they put him down
Special shoutout to doesthedogdie.com
And the owner gets married and I think the wife didnt like the dog as much
I already don't wanna read this
It was like the dog gets adopted by a kid / teenager and they grow up together
But it was pretty messed up
It was the dogs whole life
Well the whole story wasnt about being put down
It was like the great tragic literature of my childhood
Wtf
And it was like a first person perspective
When I was a kid I read a short story on like Powerpets about a dog getting put down
also i read this thing about how when dogs are being put down they look for their owner so vets say you should be there
holy fuck that's insane
Death can be so noble
Yeah
Wait did it die like, right then
I was crying for like 15 minutes it was the saddest thing I've ever seen
On friday night my friend's hamster crawled out of its cage and limped towards her before quietly passing away
https://wagwalking.com/behavior/why-dogs-want-to-be-alone-when-they-die
Then I thought about dogs hiding when theyre dying and I found this
It adds such a legendary air
I thought about all this because of how Lawrence Oates walked into the blizzard and disappeared instead of just dying like everyone else in the expedition
Its weird how much of a difference disappearing makes vs just dying
Thats the kind of backstory of someone who ascends straight to FGO
Disappeared while on a search mission
Possibly the first person to reach both the north and south poles
This guy was cool though
Maybe Amundsen Coast after
Should we check out the Amundsen Glacier or the Amundsen Basin first?
Imagine if you were sightseeing in Antarctica

Literally hate people
Yeah changing the name from global warming to climate change hurt the legitimacy to the halfwits
Imagine if it had been branded as global temperature fuckery from the onset
Is what i would say
Its fine guys, global warming will offset this
Pretty crazy stuff
i know cars will be affected by this weather like justin said
They might be affected
I saw Armada had issues but he always does anyway
Are genesis flights getting affected
Good thing Frostbite isnt this week
Like i havent been there but have you seen their pizza
Probably
Is chicago hell
We were so right :(
No one listened when they said there were too many sequels
Trump will come to power when hell hath frozen over
You cant make this shit up
The government shutdown might resume while america goes through a fucking ice age
We shouldve kept the cold out with a border wall
Which makes it sound like its minor for now but buildings will make noises in harsh cold at least
His death is super romanticized
Okay so structures are expected to show cracks come Spring
Do you guys know captain Lawrence Oates
Freezing to death is such a concept
Thats what im asking
Wait but like do animals just die
Its the temperature modified by wind and humidity and stuff
does anyone know how "feels like" works
Im already dead at 10 degrees
monkaS
Okay so apparently structures aren't affected by windchills but it's only giving me examples as low as 10 degrees
Hooooly
Which broke its old record by 8 degrees
Bruh
But apparently Minnesota hit -44 on Sunday
And Chicago is expected to hit -23
Okay the coldest in Chicago ever was -27
Ohhh
Not actually the record
By how much
Nah its a potential record low
-23 still seems far from normal winter temps or is chicago just always like this?
Like hypothetically
Is there a limit to how much of a difference there can be
Feels like temp is such a weird concept
Chicago tribune says the expected low is -23, and could feel as low as -50
Just googled it
A friend of mine inbthe midwest is in normals of -1 rn
Wait where says that
Well its like 50 degrees this time
So like this is still terrifying
The feels temperature isn't ever more than 10degrees from the real one from what I've seen
Still air is warmer
So with wind its this temp
Whats the difference between that and actual temp lol
Its windchill
This is the feels like temperature right
But they must be right?
Okay but like
Like I never considered until now if properties are rated for temperatures
Oh def. Itll break trees and shit
I wonder if it could cause property damage
I think other crazy shit starts freezing
fucked
@Mega Gastly "Mega Gastly Gastly" Gastly
Water in cars might freeze
But like, exposed skin is mega mega fucked in this
I was in -15 weather once and I rented special gear for it
Not since the last arctic chill
*fyi
Vodka freezes at -16 just fui
Does Chicago have life?
Like would this just wipe out crops and livestock if not protected
Anyone know what in the world will be affected by this? I don't have a good concept of temperatures below like -15
Ho3k could learn a lesson from this

Its sad cause you're right
While like, the icecaps are melting and the rest of the world is on fire
They're just going to say "Damn need some of the GLOBAL WARMING am I right?!?!?"
Wait what
To prove a point lol
Why the fuck does the arctic chill have to be hitting the part of the world with the most imbeciles denying climate change

Oh
Wait what
stay woke
they're purging the homeless
used the government shutdown and temporary re-opening to distract you
the government bought a lot of those AmazonBasics laptop cooling pads and propped them all over the country
It's a government conspiracy
Wait so why is temperature that feels like -60 degrees happening lol
Are cookies and pretzels bread
If you bake cookies then you probably cook bacon
If you boil dough it becomes pasta
If you bake dough it becomes bread
what a stimulating conversation
No
Is pasta bread
I laughed really hard
a sense of horror grew within me when I reread this
https://twitter.com/TalesOfTayls/status/1089628859841105921
Take that lizard people
There we go
Wait robes cant close by zipper
Thats by definition a jacket
Fuck
what about a zipper jacket
A snuggie is an abomination
So A Snuggie is not a robe
Like over the shoulder shit
Jupiter wears legit robes
How is this enough to make Jupiter enrobed but not Saturn
With sleeves
But mostly concealing imo
A robe needs to be open in the front
Mood
Which it is not
I like is a toga is a robe better than our current argument lol
Mouse can be tusk cause elephants are afraid of mice (i guess)
a bathrobe might as well be a towel
I always pictured him in armor tho realistically
Nah a toga is a towel
a toga is a robe
Thats a toga
wait but for real tho how is tusk or any form of enrobed mouse

like it's not robe but it's enrobed
i'd guess saturn cause it's enrobed in a ring lmao
No robes
Saturn was a titan
why not saturn
Id have guessed jupiter on that
the shapchat ghost is a dick under a tissue tho
*gods
like the snapchat ghost
I almost guessed Jupiter for robes since Jupiter is the king of the Roman God
ghosts are basically just robes but like ethereal
Like ghosts?
If it was enrobe it could be connected with the process of putting things in robes
how is mouse enrobed or tusk
So queen and princess would have been better choices than yard and Jupiter
Enrobed makes the most sense because it makes you think of the things in the robe
Wait, ghosts wear robes wut
i was thinking things like why enrobed and not enrobe or robe or robed lmao
Fair but thats more of a stretch, though id grt mouse off that maybe
Plague works because its associated with the medieval era
ghosts wear robes
wait how is tusk for mouse
How does enrobe convey ghost?
Enrobe is good for the 4 but not the 5
I can't think of a better play
Cause elephants are scared of mice
Was tusk a clue to multiple?
That kinda makes sense
enrobe was pretty good
idk but Julius said tusk was for mouse
How does tusk = mouse
it was
Mouse was not part of a previous clue
He said enrobe
Mouse was part of a previous clue so he possibly only needed the first 4
What did he say?
Julius had to convey Queen Princess Ghost Greece and Mouse with 1 clue
I don't understand like any of them besides mouse and arguably ghost
That wasnt the one I would have thought you wouldnt understand lol
And most words probably had much less to do with plague
Cause you can see the whole board
Because medieval era
In context it probably made more sense
Yeah i got that, but idk how thata possible
Codenames
Wait princess from plague?

how would you get princess from plague
Depends on your reference point
What year is it
I dont remember anything that happened last night
But if he said robe I would have said Jupiter
If Julius said plague I would have got it
I thought about codenames
today i learned i'm a cannibal
Like Depression
There are lots of diseases that you get from eating human
ok eat rich people but also veggies
i wish you said that earlier
Cannibalism actually is really unhealthy
eat only rich people
You've inspired me. I'm going on the Jordan Peterson all-meat diet to save our planet
For the earth
Still not going to stop me from eating as many as I can
We make a shitton more cows than would normally exist for the sake of consumption
So there are less cows
Shouldnt we eat more of them 
If cows are farting too much
It's heavy stuff, and we're all going to hell. Have a nice cock
Like, if you buy genetically modified seeds by Monsanto, you can't take the seeds from the crops you grow. You have to buy more
Among the most fucked up things Monsanto is doing is literally "patenting" genetically modified seeds
Hell, I read this article that says even vegetable growing practices have a lot of fucked up shit going on (of course, courtesy of capitalism)
I haven't done the required reading but I've heard that a lot of people go vegan because like, farm practices aren't just inhumane, they're mega inefficient and detrimental to the environment. Cows for example fart a huge amount of methane into the atmosphere in aggregate. Some people go as far as to say that going vegan is going to become straight-up necessary to reduce carbon emissions, whether you care about the animals or not. Of course, there's the problem of "well why do inviduals have to change their behavior if the vast majority of emissions are emitted by a small number of corporations" which becomes a whole ethical argument of its own.
The egg wouldnt hatch anyway
Wait a minute
Sorry fellas

Gonna make eggs
Same :(
Ate an egg 
We need to take the money from like WebAssign and save the ice caps with it
is it just another one of those days where you need to overthrow capitalism to literally save earth
they probably don't have many alternatives
The question is do our feelings of guilt do anything tangible to offset the amount of environmental damage we cause engaging in harmful production practices
Actually they probably know what an egg is
Other animals don't know better
Doesn't that make it even worse that we elect to do so
To be fair humans probably feel worse about eating eggs than any other organisms
I wrote of all of that and it sounds like villian talk
Wow humans are monsters
Gotta consider the time it takes to reap the benefits of the egg hatching vs the immediate benefit of just eating the egg
I feel like that makes it arguably not value loss
uh probably not, also what a value loss
Can those eggs hatch
whenever i eat fish eggs i think wow what a value loss
It ought to give you that vibe
It's the basis for a whole ass big chicken
When I eat just one egg I always think damn wtf
Yeah I think what Thao said is correct, it's all optimized so that they can create eggs for their young with very little
Not directly but like in whatever way prevents chickens from violating physics when they produce eggs
probably an overwhelming amount of energy in a chicken goes into making eggs which is why they're so efficient
Basically what I assumed was chickens eat stuff and then it turns into whatever goes into eggs somehow
I guess? I think the connection between diet and what a thing is made of really arent that connected
yeah like you can make amino acids out of other things
Do the chickens make it
But the protein in the eggs has to come from somewhere right
Flies literally eat shit but contain protein because living things are made of protein
Living things have nutrients even if they dont consume those same nutrients
Where is this shtuff coming from
chickens just eat like corn and water and that's just veggies but chickens/eggs provide protein/calcium and other stuff like that
But how do they make so many eggs, and why do eggs have so much shtuff
And they make a ton of em
Are we just worse at using whatever chickens use from what they eat
I think eggs are just that packed with shtuff
Losing energy as you go up the food chain or something
In the context of like
I dont understand why feeding chickens and getting eggs is like, efficient
More like we genetically modify them so that they get too big to do anything but wallow in their mass and eventually die??
Wait while were on chickens  and my lack of bio knowledge
Like, we make them chill in their own shit until we kill them?
@Mega fucked
I like categorization but when dog shows are like this is the norwegian hartfordshire yip terrier drink mix Im like Stop
Yeah it's so sad
We're such assholes to them
Chickens are mega fucked rn
They have it horrible
"European dog with fucked up face"
Late to the convo but did we discuss chickens yet
like what is the creation of new breeds
and then suddenly pug is its own breed
Dogs that will be pugs
in terms of where they came from
"Dog with fucked up face"
but i mean like before pugs were a breed, there had to be some way to express what they are
Its helpful gor categorization
It would be weird referring to them otherwise
Dog breeding is messed
Ok i dont think id go that far but ye i feel
or like the distinction between breeds is kind of arbitrary
also how arbitrary it is to assign dogs into breeds in the first place
yes and how unbelievably fucked up dog breeding is in general

Ya ever think about how we gave pugs horrible breathing problems and keep breeding them into existence because theyre cute
yeah probably
Did the proportion of birds that did that just increase over time or what
Ye i guess
There was a bird, or a bird ancestor that built the first nest right
Okay but like
The me in that universe is the same though
Rolling around at the speed of hgg
We would be some kind of newgrounds game lol
Yo, imagine humans, only with our intelligence and speed flipped
Yeah and yet people still voted for a sentient carrot smdh
Yeah imagine if all our stats went into def or luk instead
so much of human evolution was to facilitate being smart over like everything else
Its probably what birds tweet about
Real talk tho, the fact that human awareness is at the point where we can consciously talk about this is crazy
Impressive to do it in just 2019 years though
The universe is slacking IMO why dont we have gills
I mean if I had 14 billion years to figure out how to put bugs together I probably could
Theres so many things like babies naturally recoiling from fire / heat that you dont really question, but in theory that reflex could just not exist
I feel like nature is just so smart
Theyd probably feel really weird about nest building
Itd be interesting if birds became self-aware

JULIAN I DONT NEED NIGHTMARES
Thatd be some shit
Imagine a bee nest
It seems crazy to me because building a nest just seems so specific and conscious
Like imagine a crocodile nest
We should do that and put it in something that would be absolutely terrifying with nest building abilities
Is it possible at least hypothetically to isolate the exact part of bird biology that compels them to build nests
So like
Emotions like anger and jealousy can be useful but will generally make you less favorable among your peers
Like the example I see is birds building nests
Well I just dont understand really
I think its interesting that some things that were useful to us in the wild are actively detrimental to us in human society
I think?
Like, we naturally learn to do things to such an internal degree we can do it without thought
But do you instinctively twist counter clockwise 
But real talk evolution and instinct are soo interesting
Yet i still cant open the fucking pickle jar
Living things can just automatically do things
The notion of instinct is so crazy
No
Like the 2 player Powerpuff Girls game on the Cartoon Network site
I feel like maybe I might have used it for a multiplayer flash game at some point
Wait I tried using it and its actually not that bad
Mood
O shit theres a shift key on the right
The shift key on the right
The what
And why
Has anyone ever pressed the right shift
Its me
I guess one of us isnt part of humanity
Im quick on the shift
I make a lot of typos but I dont think thats ever happened to me
Well like in typing, hopefully not in handwriting
Wait is that a thing that happens
Like when people accidentally capitalize the second letter of their name
You guys ever see things that infuse you with a kindred connection to all humanity
I Agree

*dies*
and there's nothing spooky about that
and it follows that there can be many other things that are linked together by similar bonds
I know that if he was to feel something, then I would too
or where I am
That's exactly how I'd want to die
Because no matter where Andy is in this universe
In fact
I could just be in a room with allen typing a story and maybe listening to jazz and i think I'd be okay to die
I know why is happens
I feel like this doesnt add up, but I dont know enough to challenge the translation
there's "spooky action at a distance" which is like violating physics as in like no one knows how or why it happens??? so physics hasn't changed to explain it yet

taking matter that exists and changing it but maintaining the overall integrity
i think that's the idea of equivalent exchange
Or was physics already changed from the beginning
Actually is it possible to violate physics or would physics just change
nsm au where paul is the first jew
My b
It was gonna be a surprise
You do too
im still waiting for my post-high school intelligence
wait yall have other incarnations?
I guarantee my homo habilis incarnation has this exact conversation with Andys but without numbers
I'm in a pool of my own fluids
"I dont think theres standardized nomenclature for exhibits"
were there even exhibits before numbers
Allen do you ever think about how goddamn shwet you make people when you talk
How do you think people made their cases before numbers
Like
I dont think theres standardized nomenclature for exhibits
Anywhomst
Exhibit A is a thing
Exhibits are in letters i thought
FMA
I present Exhibit 1
the only game i knew frame data for was sf4 so a 4 frame not-jab is ridiculous
But it's also arguably moral
If i could violate physics to save someone's life idk if that's immoral
Morality is in the intention
Is it inherently amoral to violate physics
sf made me think anything below 3 is like a violation of physics and morals
Frames=x+20 is straight up in the code
In fact
yeah that's it
Frames=x+20
Like
Is there a formula for how many frames a move takes when in witch time
Sometimes people are surprised if their frame 4 move loses to a frame 3 move but it's like, the comparison hinges on you attacking at the exact same time
Who needs math when you can just read
I think it can be misleading for head to head purposes though
But snake ftilt being frame 4 is like okay its just slower than jab
Because frame 4 being 1 frame slower than frame 3 is kind of hard to internalize
Fuck numbos
Oh word i'm not a nerd
cuz i use frame data for counterplay
Relating to other moves is probably the easiest way we can understand the differences though
But in Smash gotta readjust
im with yaseen
In DBFZ Gohan had a 6frame jab and I was like damn that's fucked up
one is a raw measurement of time and the other is a relation to other moves for interaction purposes
The relation relies on the numbers
It's in relation to other moves
What's the difference
Do you interpret frame data more in numbers or in relation to other moves
When someone says that I think combo breaker
Is mario nair not fast?
Or more generally
Or like Mario nair
Is your mental reaction that thats fast
If someone tells you a move is like frame 3
The other thing I wanted to ask was
An interstellar moment if you will
In some plane
Itd be like your minds meet
People are probably wondering if we're gonna make the numbers continue
Woah if they did think that
Like, i wonder if anyone said anything along the lines of
It's a fifty fifty whether or not they were thinking that someone was thinking they'd have this conversation
Moving on
And it made me think about all the other potentially similar situations where you can be confident that the conversation was had
And I was filled with an overwhelming certainty that that was a conversation that was had
And I wondered why they didnt reset the series number for ultimate
I was looking at xeno bracket
Why!!!!!

I almost 
Okay it isnt
Wait is that what the super bowl is
Imagine a world in which trophies were bowls instead of cups
Or tba rather
his coming is upon us
Date tbd
mid feb?
Within a month
also whens piranha plant coming out
Technically Paper Mario is in smash
i need paper mario in smash
Paper mario gets my rawk kawk hard
Please
Paper Mario give me a fighter
paper mario 64 giving you a full null pointer exception stack trace
Not even lucas can
Explain pk freeze
@treyarch btw
I think freezing games is frowned upon
and made that sound
i understand why but i thought itd be so funny if it froze your game
And it makes sense cuz it basically records a list of inputs and patches can change how those inputs operate. Lets say you playback someone 2framing with a move and then a patch comes out to add startup to that move, it wouldnt be the same video and everything would be off by a lot
Heres an explanation for patches breaking replays I wrote for someone else
You cant watch them anymore
and freezes your game
or can you watch it but its all wrong
does the game not let you play it?
Once you update you cant watch old replays anymore
Even if it wouldnt affect the specific replay
Patches break old replays
like does your game freeze
and patches although ive never seen that
Oh wait that actually happens with mods
This isnt an answer, but sometimes I imagine creepypastas of replays coming back wrong
can they be exported to sd card still?
Smash replays are all the inputs of a match mapped to some sort of text file and then played back like a TAS I'm pretty sure.  Do replays of 8 player smash make files 4 times the size of a 1v1? Is it a noticeable difference?
the capture on the preview window is always delayed
and watching the preview window while playing instead of his monitor
like he was streaming with OBS
Obs?
Same
I worry that Ryans twitter is becoming too powerful
Hes right
https://twitter.com/wyldfirenyc/status/1087414849682984961?s=21
Thats why he was banned
I cant get over Mango getting elite smashed through OBS lol
Its a weird but cool world
Mango is saying hes giving wario practice
Hope he makes a good run
He went to Tweek/Cosmos house
Armada is actually grinding for genesis
He streams but he doesnt have nearly as big of a stream
Idk what Armada is doing
is that what armadas doing now too?
Its almost unheard of to basically retire while at the top in any esport, and he did it in a way where hes making way more money now
That said, what Zero has done in the last year is pretty incredible
whoa zero with the self care
Idk if I can bear to see Tweek tweet this in 5 years

Zero lost his soul
Cooler wants to know your location
move to a heavier planet where there's only iron and become a metal-based lifeform
Of course, this whole thing is the philosophical conundrum of The Ship Of Theseus
I can't wait to have a metal limb
So yes, you can have an element be a part of your body
Im super late but I believe bloodworms have copper teeth

i'd want to see if i could see my daick glowing through her
oh absolutely
would you have sex with someone glowing
would you wanna explore the possibilities or leave the rabbit hole
would you keep going back to that place
what if you went to a specific place and started glowing but when you left it stopped
ohh that makes sense haha
Or just disease
And one that isnt evil
Those colors feel most likely to be from me gaining a power
i feel like we did
We should populate this chat so that theres someone capable of fielding any question
haha why
youd be hype to glow white, yellow, or orange?
Positive, negative, negative, negative, positive, negative, positive
tell me your reaction for each
white, red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange
Yeah
does your reaction change depending on the color lmao
What color
how would you react if you started glowing lol
I wouldnt
yo that actually sounds like a mad hype origin story
they'd probably evolve away from being unstable
that sounds like a good premise
What if their lifespan is shorter than the rate of decay
also idk if an organism could have an element in it that naturally decays???
carbon is the basis of life cause it can form 4 covalent bonds which is the most so some people say it could be possible that there's silicon based aliens
you can find heavier elements where gravity is heavier i guess
in the universe in general, all the elemental proportions are the same

life is probably more acidic
eVoLuTiOn
Life is basic
life finds the easiest route
yeah^^^
irons atomic number is way smaller and more common
And could it be tungsten
But why is it iron and not like tungsten
like hemoglobin actually has iron in it i think
iron is in people because metals form complexes with organic molecules
no one can explain vegans
wait i feel like i could probably answer these questions cause i learned it
but fucking doing it was bullshit
haha i always found the concepts of chemistry really interesting
so the main elements like carbon, oxygen, iron, etc probably form the easiest bonds
Andy with the 
Explain vegans
life finds the easiest route
due to repelling or otherwise not having the ability to form bonds based on electrons
and some simply cannot bond with others
Why is iron in people
these atomic numbers differentiate them
that have an exact number of neutrons, protons, and most times electrons
elements are very specific atoms
Im trying to understand the nature of what elements are
cause gaseous life forms are always cool
i believe personally
I think we have such little knowledge of what alien biology would look like they could be anything
it isnt within our realm of knowledge
Could there feasibly be aliens that are part neon
Humans elemental composition is already established but like
Everything happened because of another thing
and then divine magiks on top of that
Probably not but I could see an argument for it
primordial soup has pretty specific ingredients
Does that not count
does that count as natural
And theyre just radioactive
What if its like a dog breed that happened because of Chernobyl
Like what makes something like iron part of organic life, but not like neon
naturally you will never have neon in your body
I think hypothetically it would be possible for any element
Thats what Im asking though
and just how nothing to do with organic life some elements are
I mean like hypothetically
Theres no Plutonium type
cause of how rare they are
Why not
then nah
Like plutonium
like fire or like plutonium
Can any element be part of an organism naturally
Or brawl
Just so were all on the same page ancient twitch chat is watching yugioh right
Like a character might not necessarily correspond to a phonetic sound that combines with others to make a word
Damn imagine typing the hieroglyphic of PogChamp to get the word to show up
I dont know much about hieroglyphics but I feel like a lot of ancient writing systems treated language itself differently
Unless the emotes were words
Because itd be harder to immediately distinguish between them
I feel like hieroglyphics would have some conflict with emotes
Now I'm thinking of Ancient Twitch chat
I wonder what they said during ancient esports
I don't know how you can make a comeback in any facet without the phrase
I think let's go probably has an equivalent expression in other languages that would also be weird to translate to English
Its not really the same but translating lets go is probably also weird
I do that in English too
I appreciate that in Chinese the primary way to cheer someone on is to say add oil
And even if it weren't the case, they're still hypothetically fake deep for thinking the quote isn't anything more than "it's what u do not what u are"
*messing
Yo yaseen missing with the emo ghosts is actually concept of 2007 or something
As a kid even before I understood how integral the birth lottery was I knew that m2 quote was bullshit
Those too but I messed with em lmao
*it
I think these things started out

Also random thought def equates to "I wanted no smoke on Twitter so it goes here"
The "circumstances of one's birth" Mewtwo quote is the basis by which fake deep originated
Random thought
true
Although in some ways story writing is basically a way to communicate with everyone, without the pressure of having to think on the spot
If I had the chance to broadcast a message telepathically to all of humanity, I'd use it to fuck with people
Like realistically the most impactful thing I could do is probably ask for everyones ki
Sometimes I think about what Id say if I had a chance to communicate with everyone but its just too hard to not panic and not say something thats trite or a meme
nah
The world would be a peaceful place
Like imagine if everyone on the planet knew and understood those words
Tingo
Nothing can ever beat that
Is the ultimate saying
"I agree to an extent but in this context I understand it"
I love yaseen
Lol i love how yaseen words things
Doing wrong for personal gain is the big takeaway
like, it's an economic mode of production conceived by humans for use by humans.
I agree to an extent but in this context I understand it
that like... i don't think it's saying much to reference it
human nature is such a nebulous concept
i n v i s i b l e   h a n d
Part of its appeal as an ideology is that in a perfect world it would be perfect
I honestly dont think capitalism is inherently terrible tbh but human nature + capitalism can be very bad
As much as I hate capitalism I have to admit it has interesting ways of responding to its inherent contradictions. Too bad global warming is going to cascade into like 7 different crisis-es, all of which are bigger than anything it's had to deal with before and countless innocent people are going to die and human civilization might collapse please God end us now
I misunderstood
Ah interesting didnt look at it that way
Some chit
And serving the country
Free time implies time not working
You have to dodge his cars
also i could imagine walking up to him and then a big health bar pops up like dark souls and it says "ultra capitalist henry ford"
Which I think is fascinating
Ford normalized a 40 hour work week but not so his employees would be healthy but so they could be better consumers
fuk
loooooooooooool
So saying wed have no free time without money is a definite exaggeration but it has an interesting history in the US
@Thao the reason money and free time are connected are because of ultra capitalist Henry Ford. Workers used to work 10-16 hours a day but Ford realized they would have more time to spend money if they werent working all the time
I think?
Is a bushel a unit of volume
Then you've effectively made money and its nolonger anbartering society
"Ill give you 7 bushels of wheat in 7 months for this car"
Like imagine trying to get a car as a farmer during the winter.
I feel like the most important thing to do in bartering is to establish a thing thats like money
Moneys major benefit is that it is a storage of value. I can accumulate wealth now and spend it later. In bartering thats nigh impossible due to things naturally having more value now than they do in the future
Id just walk if Pennsylvania had the concept of sidewalks
Should I make eye contact
My Lyft driver is coming from like 25 minutes away to drive me 5 minutes
Itd be bartering time
wait why would we have no free time without money
Money is a premier reason we are able to have down time in the first place
Games probably wouldnt exist
They probably wouldnt exist
sometimes i think theres so many games with money like what if we existed in a moneyless society like bartering, what would games look like

Being full priced with lootboxes
*Overwatchs
I like overwatches model a lot for it
Money never meant you won either 
The model was still buns though not gonna defend it any further
Money never meant you lost the game
Words to live by
League was not the first pay or grind, will not be the last, and was never the most offensive

So it expedited the way you could grind
AdventureQuest
It wasnt free
Free realms made you pay for stuff
Runescape got you new quests and areas
like i think maple story had stuff you could get with in game money or real money but not items that you can get with both
oooh i see what you mean
And then everyone else did it
League was the game that juxtaposed the Pay option directly with Get It For Free By Playing Forever
I think it was just cosmetics. MapleStory was just straight-up "Pay for Things"
It stopped the problem of having worldly possessions
like what did paying in runescape get you
Runescape was my shit
were runescape and maple story pay or grind?
League definitely paved the way for the "pay or grind" payment model.
The FGC and shooters and other games already existed competitively but League kind of broke the barrier for all esports
And it was one of the least qualified
It was the first super money esport
Even if the gameplay itself wasnt really new I feel like it paved the way for a lot of modern esports
League probably changed the world a lot
do you think a ton of concept artists became concept artists cause of league
Its catchy but in a vaguely malevolent way
Literal
It was too descriptive and literally
Something about that subtitle always seemed off
Graves the blind monk
Idk why but when I see champ names I uncontrollably think the blind monk after their name
Wasnt lee sin a mage
a little boy named graves
Named Warwick
Warwick was just a person
And like
A real pirate is a pirate from birth
Like was Gangplanks name Gangplank before he was a pirate
You could say that for a lot of champs though
Assuming that was still his name
Although it would have been weird when he was alive
Its just perfect
Amumu might be the most fitting name in league
Amumu and azir are so different lol
And then they went back to normal lol
And it has an entire arc where they tried to totally reboot themselves and be something totally different
Shuriiiiima
Yo they got the pyramids AND the sphinx??
Its actually so ridiculous
You ever just think about all of ancient Egypt
It's a mythical creature whose statue was constructed in the past
How come the Sphinx is like the face of the past
also the sphinx
literally traveling in time to hit you into your past self
imagine if sonics final smash was flash's injustice super
He took being fast way too far
And spring man is crying
The flash actually needs to be stopped
Like, his body is indestructible
like vibrating your molecules
also all the fast people can get a discord and lab together
Plastic man is actually one of the most powerful characters in the dc universe just cause of the nature of his stretching powers
Or dhalsim combos
like mr fantastic changing his face
all the stretchy ppl need to learn from each other
Fuffy can't even legally become a boat
Since she isnt weak to anything
With sanji kicking in the back
Oh yeah becoming a boat might give her the edge
Like imagine duffy as a boat
But she can like become any shape
But she definitely has less power
I think she stretches more
I wonder if more people know her than buffy
Is she stronger than puffy
She hasnt even needed to use gear second yet
elastigirl should do that
Stop Im gonna think about it
Like, rubber banding your blood vessels to make them pump faster makes you go faster
I dont like that its called gear second because Id accept it if it was like a small series with an appropriately gratuitous translation but in this case is there any actual reason it isnt just second gear
I love that gear second just sounds like it works and makes sense if you don't think about it at all

BAC 3
bac over 100%
Lol the policeman has to crush his scanner

I dont have to imagine
Nah but imagine if you circulated your blood so fast the bac scanner counted it twice
Or how it works
Is that what gear second is
Gear second
Wait is it valid to decrease your BAC by increasing your blood
Now that's what i call woke
Imagine if vampires had alcohol in their veins, and consuming blood increased their alcohol blood concentration

it didn't
does that really change anything
I thought he said goos
watch on netflix
I need subtitles
I couldn't tell what he was saying
fiends

The scene where they put together his online dating profile is top tier
Its one of the best episodes
Yeah
it looks like my online dates
is this a date

I may need to pull the always sunny clip
And philanthropist
therapist is the most unfortunate word like that
demonstration and other forms... you dont notice demon and monster are there  Then you say demonstrable and usually hear one or both of those
Doughchkkknut
Donut
Like page is a perfectly respectable word but paginate is just gross
I was thinking that yesterday
Some forms of words are way more disgusting than the other forms of those words
(For reasons you still don't understand)
Also
Wrist strain injury
What's rsi
Did anyone else think the R in RSI stood for wrist
Its like when you play an RPG and dont know what to do so you choose the cool skills and then you find out that this is the most OP build
Lol its like how did I get this far up the skill tree
Nuclesr medicine was the most terrified ive ever been for a harmless procedure lol
Nuclear medicine physician sounds so cool
Hes just a goose
Its like the ugly duckling
Its like Wonder Woman being outside Themyscira
Actually that comparison holds up less the more I think about it but it functions on a surface level
Its like goku being on earth
But i feel American in America
It gets brought up at every possible opportunity more
It stands out more
I'm more aware of it in Asia
Precisely the thing
See that's the thing right
@Andy do you feel more American in America or China
What about when all they have to say is PTSD
that really upsets me and i hope im never like that but with some other country
and all the touristy things they did
i just never want to be like when white people visit vietnam and all they have to say is that its beautiful or something
Im just afraid I might just die for no reason
I worry about imagining more difference between whats familiar to me, and what isnt, than what exists in reality
Experiencing different places and cultures is exciting, but in a way that idea can be somewhat narrow-minded
I dont really understand how I feel about it
i never traveled as a kid and havent traveled at all as an adult so i guess i dont know the experience or how good/bad it is
Sometimes I think about becoming a nomad
Its really hard to do that stuff if you live with family
Canada
Or like
This year I might try to go to the Netherlands
Most kids are
When I was a kid I was really unappreciative of traveling but now I try to do as much as I can
idk i have no idea cause my parents are planning the trip
How long?
Goals
im gonna go and be able to communicate with no one basically and be stuck with my family with questionable values for a long time
That was the timeline
By incin
I needed to be murdered with sheik
While we were at Xian
I was gonna ask if you wanted to gentleman to bayo sheik game 35
Picking Bayo had the biggest expected value
I was excited to go to Asia
Wait why do you say that thao
We were close
Im offended you didnt leave Ike
I thought you understood that was the true ending
I cant leave North America
@Chris Im offended you didnt leave bayo for me to go last game
but also thats what chinese people feel going to china and almost every chinese person i know does that
Like main universe was like, imagine if we had the next smash game already while being Bayo combod
i might be leaving north america for the first time this summer to go to vietnam and it definitely doesnt sound good
We could actually be cousins
Actually ask him tho Chris
Id rather go to somewhere I want to go to less for the sake of saying I went
We are the timeline that smash ultimate came out early for no reason
Cause fuck most things in Australia
But just to say i have been
I think I will within like 5 years
Yo SAME
I want to go to Australia
But i am from Australia
*brands
*means
AUs collide
I am NOT the main universe Andy by any brands
Oh definitely
The main one
Probably is you from an AU
His family origin
Ask him
How that shit happened
So i need to know
The Nexus Bow
They don't
i didnt even know other people had the last name bow

Affirmative
his name is andy bow???
wait is that wonton warrior
And I know him
In smash too
Id be okay with it if he didnt main Mac
Like, on what grounds
I'm mad that there's someone else named Andy bow
Act
How to react to a reaction
Yes to apart

No
Yall trying to be apart of SA 

My Bunny Diamond endgame is at hand
And then die

NNSM
New NYU Salt Mines
I like nsm as an initialism but NY salt mines isn't catchy
NYU Succ Zone
bunny global
NSZ
If its the last thing Ill do
Nah we getting rid of it
yea its a bad origin but now nsm sounds ok
Im coming for you Jeff
Why does everyone else have money. I should be the only one

Because the economy 
Y tho
Im so salty
@Mega Gastly "Mega Gastly Gastly" Gastly
There are no salty people in nyu anymore
That sounds like a horrible name origin tbh
NSM Salt Mines
I still dont get nyu saltmines
tbh im kind of sad that nsm is still nsm and not some other name but like its pretty good
Thats fucked up
Excellent
Yaseen set his own nickname to Yaseen.
You ever realize that some Megas in Pokmon are less viable than the not Mega form
Damn no Garchomp
Human Wu's Father set the nickname for Chris Colon to Mega Gastly "Mega Gastly Gastly" Gastly.
mega gaogaen
Or the obvious one that actually works MeGa Garchomp
Wait why not MeGa G(a)engar
MeGa Gastly
Mega Gastly
theres only methylamine gas
im trying so hard to do like a "whats cardi b short for -> cardiovascular bronchitis" but with mega and i cant think of anything
Of course
I was actually thinking of changing it to that
Do you think my life would be substantially different if my tag had been OwsLa all this time
Like yaseens tag should just be Yaseen
So I guess youre right
Also its Cortes
You mean Ikon
Like angel Cortez
A light more powerful than light
Tags are more unique
But I can remember tags
Lord of mega light
Is it sad I cant remember names
MeGalleem
Just call me MeGa

That movie is on my watch list so there's probably a universe where I wasn't told and I'm watching it like in Japan or something and I'm just like "Yo"
Yo Iris discovered the meaning of Owsla independently last month
Explain
I dont think Ive ever had a handle I didnt need to explain to people and I think that says a lot about me
One thing that I appreciate, which is somewhat new with our generation is Ive had various online handles over the years and its pretty cool how they each have their own amount of significance and aspects of their life that theyre tied to
Im not sure how much significance Ive put into names throughout my life
More free time to come up with things when you don't spend all day flying
How come penguins are so randomly powerful that they have names, wholesome gay families and prostitution
Penguins partners spend days just saying their names to each other so they can find one another during the madness and crowds of egg laying season
Trying to think of my friends but in a way removed from their names feels really weird
Or like who they are
When we think about people, do we think of them by their names
Penguins
It exists among certain animals too
The entire concept of names is so human
I think a lot of my concerns about names come down to imagine a kid being named that in 2nd grade but it also seems super complicated to make a distinction
Should there be different standards for names for adults and names for kids?
The Olimar combos chat picture is chaos theory
So even if you make an argument that you should have the right to be called Fuck if you want, is it like reasonable to name another person that
I meant to send this after the enabling chaos thing slow on the draw

One thing that complicates it is that in the standard case, the name the person picks isnt for themselves
Its hard to walk the line between censorship, and not enabling chaos
I guess we just don't draw the line?
Yeah where do we draw the line
So I wonder who it is that makes the call for individual names
But its kind of hard to have defined standards for that
I feel like practically, excessively long / gibberish / obscene names should probably not be allowed
On a moral level it's probably not right but practically you shouldn't be allowed to name a baby Hitler
What do you guys think about name legality
Jose is legal
ive never met a jose in california
how is there no joses in california
And you cant be named Batman in Australia
how is that even possible
Lol
This website says Jos is an illegal name in California
Did you guys know some names are just straight up illegal
What do I call 2Pac
Francis Scott
I like F though
You'd shorthand it as F Scott I think
But like, do you introduce him as F Scott, Scott, Francis or F
Yeah because with the other configurations you can just say their first name regardless
I knew there was an obvious one
Ohhh right
like f scott fitzgerald
Initial at the start 
Initial at the end, fair enough
Like, initial in the middle of the name, sure
That seems like the persona they're trying to create

Cause it's almost like the intent is to confuse and discomfort
Example
I think it usually means theyre going by their middle name but I can never be sure
I get confused and discomforted when people have an initial at the start of their name
https://youtu.be/InbaU387Wl8
and fast
tldw: talk loud

In terms of literal icons
KND has the most iconic OP
Did that happen
What about when they became bald
Its like if Sora took his shoes off and his feet were the same size
The only bad thing about it was when you saw the characters bare feet some Eldritch shit
There was so much creativity and imagination put into that show
I feel like the KND world is more expansive and fleshed out than it reasonably should be

Sector Z
Will one of us ever break off
I think his name was Lenny he had the helmet
Remember when one of them broke off for an episode
I had so many questions about the delightful children from down the lane
Same concept

No wait he was the 0.58 boy
I think so
Wait so was there .8 of a kid
yooooo phantom tollbooth
So they were just under 2 kids
I vaguely remember these characters who represented the concept of how the average household has 1.8 kids
Yo did anyone read Phantom Tollbooth

Wait imagine when Hel was pregnant
This is some average limbs shit

reminds me of this eric andre bit

But America didnt know
Its because hello kitty is a guy
Dang we just invented a meme format
Hello Kittys full name is Kitty White
What's the strongest thing you can think of
it raises so many questions and some of them don't even have to do with the final sentence
I don't think anyone could explain that
can someone smart explain this to me

How many league videos are in there
I wanna make a playlist of all the videos that shaped me into who I am today
Bwah
The noise he makes alone tells me he put his whole soul into it
Kevin!
I dont think Ill ever get tired of that guy kicking out the light
Mario nair is probably the true sex kick
It's transcended alignment
Where like Wario nair kinda counts but isnt a kick and on the other hand sheik ftilt is a kick but lacks sex
LOL
You could make one of those sandwich charts for this
They need to exceed a certain threshold to count
Well all kicks are sex kicks for some amount of time
That was a sex kick for a sec
Some call me a connoisseur of kicks
The snickering in the aftermath is what edges it over #2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JurGajlyEew
What's the first
This is around the 4th coolest kick Ive ever seen
Jack et off
Not like this
It was weak hit of usmash
Omg
When the Chinese kid heard the music change he probably knew it was over too lol
It was actually game 5
This movie was good
This kick was the peak of cinema
Let his brain melt
LMAOOO
Ive gotta stall Allen out next time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pfJLPOr9oA
When you foxtrot into usmash
Yo
Maybe it works on the other person too
I legitimately find it hard to focus on anything else if Im foxtrotting because the rhythm is kind of hypnotic
when i mash once my brain is so destroyed i've already lost
For reasons i
This is like days without sleeping
At 16 I've sd twice
I dont wanna know what happens past like 20
I think after 4 dashes I lose the ability to dodge things, and around 8 is when my base knowledge of the game starts to deteriorate
But then i burn out
Cause i get so juiced when i'm shmooving
It's a bell curve
Does anyone else feel their brainpower steadily decline in relation to how long theyve been foxtrotting in neutral
On a somewhat different topic
I dont think anyone can
So many layers of that assumption make no sense
I can't give you a bullshit reason for why Falco dtilt cuts off your feet btw
For reasons i still dont understand
Falco downtilt cuts off your feet, and it's like an old school choose your own adventure book or a QTE sorta dealie where you're not dead, but the resulting issues it causes might as well render you dead so we skip to you dying as a result
For reasons i still dont understand
Its important to give back to the community
I can have some?


For reasons i still dont understand
Why
For reasons i still don't understand is the best way to end any sentence
What about falco dtilt for reasons I still dont understand
what about mewtwo usmash
And it looks like that move would send you to heaven even if it didnt previously exist
Imagine getting hit by a Bowser FSmash IRL
Would Shulk's blade hurt you
Palu upsmash would literally disintegrate you physically and metaphysically
Shes canonically the most powerful fighter
PK Freeze
It has to be palu usmash I think
It takes a very long time to burn up
Humans arent actually that flammable thats why they pour gas first in movies
Yereeahhh
No wait
Palu usmash
Ridley forward smash
Any fire attack
Wario ftilt
Not counting final smashes or specials
*project
Which characters attack would be the best at completely obliterating your body the most
You can protect on any lucario
Yeah his name is Wolf ODonnel
Cause wolf has a personality
Either its some kind of tragic sacrifice or you found out shes actually evil
his name is wolf im pretty sure he has a last name
how is lucario more furry than wolf
Lol wait wolf doesn't even have a name lol
But I was thinking along the lines of what Yaseen said because if youre in that situation
Turbo human
She has a desk job
Isabelle is very human
Because he would probably just kill you
Who's more human wolf or isabelle
Well yeah dying to Wolf doesnt have a lot of depth
So lay me down on the mine and send me to Jupiter
Knowing Isabelle, if she killed you then it'd have to be because your death would serve a greater good far beyond your capacity of understanding
Lol no i'm saying that you could say the same thing about wolf
Im just saying
Im not trying to take backsies
You already picked wolf camaaaan
Sort of a weird inverse of a put the dog down moment
I think dying to Isabelle could be an interesting experience
Nah it kills in all modes
But same can practically be said for doc Nair
Not outside if Stamina mode
Can you even?
Dying to Villager/Isabelle pummel
Like the last thing you see in this world is Dr. Mario frozen in a pose
While they're posing
Yeah like you just walk into them
It would feel so bad to die to a sex kick
Z s s d t h r o w
If I had to pick a smash move to end my life I think it would be wolf bthrow
The animals should get a chance to train for it
So a cheetah is faster but we can run for longer periods of time
Did you know humans are not the best at burst running, but we're the best at endurance running of all animals
Its like theyre foxtrotting
Animals that move in bursts are scary
Let's get froggy
Oh my god allen squirt your saliva AT my uvula
nonsense
But it makes sense nonetheless
but the sense it makes is incorrect
Ducking under cover
actually just duck
Nah Duckl's aren't animals
Never
duckling
You can be humaning
Human
Name one animal verb that doesn't make sense
Dont fuck with me squiddo
Are you squidding me?
no
You know how you can put "ing" after an animal name and it makes sense as a verb
Geodude
or like
what about blooper
Squid is the most fitting name for an animal in existence
wait which thought is the instinct
squid is a good word
but also e a t
like wow theyre smart and cool
me and squids/octopi is like that
you know that book thinking fast and slow where the guy talks about instinctual vs conscious
In which case you can literally defeat any of them
But if you're not then you have a submarine
they taste good
But if you're down there youre probably dead anyway
I think because I was exposed to Blooper before real ones
I kinda like squids though
Yeah they're environmentally strong
except they might be weak idk
rock bottom still scares me today
rock bottom
like actually the high level area of the overworld
everything there is a literal monster
i still prefer to open my amazon packages with knives lmao
but yeah everything near the ocean floor should be naturally illegal
That shit always makes me squeal
No no no stop
i actually have really bad intrusive thoughts about scissors after reading this thing that was potentially not real about some girl who was kidnapped and forced to cut off her nipples with scissors
Flat is justice
2d>3d
fuck depth in general
Giant squids and shit in there fuck that
Keep that away from me
Fuck the concept of deep water
also I used to think if you released pressure on a balloon while inflating it you would die
I used to be so afraid of dogs I'd flinch if there was a handbag on the floor
especially large images of insects
im so afraid of insects
I also am pretty afraid of sharp things, but it's hard to know how severe that is compared to average fear
But more recently I've been hopeful for success
Same
I'm scared of failure
Insects
Spiders
now it's better but I'm still afraid, but like possibly within the range of normal fear
I used to have a pretty bad fear of heights
do you guys have phobias
*helped me get over it
I read a book called The Thief of Always at age 9 or so where the main kid gets to be a vampire for the night and has fun scaring his friend so that helped I think
Now I think theyre cool as hell but I was actually terrified of them
they succ
The Jackie Chan adventures episode with the vampire was rough
I just hated the concept of them
I read Dracula in 7th grade and was pretty disturbed

What was the image of vampires you were afraid of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCxVhhogDvI
until one day when I fell into a pit full of rabbits
same but for bunnies
Vampires were my biggest fear as a wee lad so I avoided those books
I mostly wanted to say umlaut
I think thats probably the most trivial experience Ive ever shared
But I had to use an umlaut
I didnt really but I named one of my league smurfs after it
Anyone read bunnicula
Its on my plan to watch
I know
Vampire Ballerina Ultimate
it is
York
Allen what's your middle name

because this highlights the benefits of knowing multiple languages, but that's actually a thing you can just work on in real life
damn I feel inspired lol
Destroying the language barrier
British
Spanish
Or you could use your knowledge of languages to make the Ultimate Language
the voices
it'd be like bruce almighty hearing the voice but with bacteria talking to you
If you take it it kind of overrides anything else you might wanna do with your life probably but it would impact the world signficantly more than if you just know languages

Then we'd know fo sho
Yeah that's mad valuable
A bunny is wiggling its nose and its saying Satan is the true lord.
See I'd personally take all languages but I feel like taking animal communication is the greater good
Imagine being able to translate animal communication for generations past your death
The former seems significantly more practical for most professional fields
it was a language
Allen read my mind
Animals be saying disturbing shit
all languages so I can read untranslated hentai
All languages
All languages
Would y'all rather be able to speak and understand all languages or be able to communicate and understand animal communication
My ganon has several dozens at this point
My Olimar might have no soul
i feel like conservatives are like if you won and then they were on the victory screen and youre like what
I feel like on average soul only weakens your play lol
Good point
Why does Max play Ridley
Conservatives play whatever character is best
Conservatives are melee players
My Marth is on thin soul ice tbh
wait if establishment democrats are diddy mains what are conservatives
By being worthless
Yeah, though it also fits Barrys definition too
But the fact that it wins also contributes to lack of soul somehow
So its kind of just there
Since it doesnt do anything unique, but it also doesnt do basic stuff well enough for that to be its identity
Yeah my Diddy is a good example
I.E. Allens Diddy
A process that can be done without real input from the creator
o jk
but then whats soulless
Soulless is more like factory-made
o jk
I put it above but I could make it more clear
chris whats your definition
Yeah
Then we have different definitions of soulless and must keep that in mind going forward
Too nebulous to put into words. I can point to examples, like 90% of harem anime or just about any speech by establishment Democrats
My Diddy has no soul
What is your definition of soulless Barry
Besides twin orcs
I agree with Chris pretty much, and also I think my Guest F has the largest portion of my soul
Nah, I believe work can be soulless regardless of how much work is put into it
Worth is external values held by others
Soulless is more of an internal concept of the art
Worthless is contribution to the outside, soulless is work/ effort put into it
No I'm not, to me the two are the same
You are confusing the two
Which of everyones smash characters are the most and least soulful
To me they're basically the same
Worthless =/= soulless
*but
People are allowed to make whatever they want because just the same I'm allowed to think their art is worthless. I don't have to justify that attitude to people. It's literally my opinion
Technically it shouldnt
If something soulless came out like 50 years ago would it have soul
Awww Chris
Just by doing it also
Its not a criteria at all. If someone wants to put effort into what they want to make, other people shouldnt ruin it
It's not the only criteria but it tends to be indicative
Something cant be soulless just because everyone else is doing it
Oh, also Saga of Tanya the Evil was a good show but its fans suck eggs in hell
enchanted
Didnt Garfield do that
For a more serious in tone isekai I'm interested in Re:Creators. It's an isekai about fictional characters coming to like, the real world

that's the good shit
Yeah the guy reincarnates as a slime
Do you know the general premise of that show
It would probably just be the slime show that I've never watched
Barry write an isekai premise
Same with Konosuba
Overlord is an example of an isekai that justifies itself because its premise is good and the writing carries it well
I mean, yeah, light novels in general have a lot of issues with being formulaic
I messed up that sentence
Light novelists are some torrential people
making a torrent of them*
Everyone and their dog*
Not well enough to justify everyone and their torrent making them
So we're in that time period
But they just work with fantasy mmorpgs really well
Yeah isekais aren't new
Narnia
Marina
The wizard of oz
i was gonna say are white ppl isekais like alice better but definitely not lmao
Is that soulless
Starring sonic
Alice in Neverland
Wreck it Ralph 2
shit i looked up the definition of unilaterally and i think i used it wrong
Do it you can't
Dont encourage me unilaterally
Just encouragement
Allen write an isekai premise
It's not about "stopping" people from arting, it's about being critical of art despite the feelings that went into it
wait is saying "you should write but just not an isekai" unilateral encouragement or just encouragement
like how come other people shouldnt be unilaterally encouraged
I mean if they are a casual
Why ever stop some one from arting
Thats like saying you should only be unilaterally encouraging in smash if they arent a casual
I don't follow. What's the question?
wait why/when would you not be encouraging of that
The only situation where you should be unilaterally encouraging of someone making art is when the person is a literal child

Again, a lot of it comes back to that writing contest that forbids isekai. I don't care how much a person cares about their work, you need to look around you and be able to say "holy shit I'm doing the same fucking thing as everyone else"
We can't study has more soul than me

Also we cant study has more soul than most manga
Like you can wear out ideas and if you still insist on using a worn-out idea the thing you're making is soulless
Its pretty pretentious lol
For me soullessness is about platitudinous-ness
Get over yourself
Like come on
And to use the word "tragic "

Like who are you, an ARTIST YOURSELF, to say something is soulless
The word itself could use a more substantial soul
That's why that tweet gets me so angry
Yeah right?
I think soulless is just too vague
I say. I'm the Emperor of Anime and I'm running for president in 30 years on the campaign of making it illegal
See i love harem anime so whos to say lol
Even if i don't think it's "good"
Pretty much any harem anime is soulless
Furry art seems like it has soul
Well "good" is subjective
Yes
Or better than not having one
Is having a soul always a good thing
But everything and everyone has some sort of soul imo
Yeah this is all debatable for sure
Whether the creative work is meant to have its own soul, or if its meant to come from the creators
Yeah
It depends on how youre interpreting the idea of the soul
It's about the media itself, not the creator
maybe its unoriginality
Absolutely
When a person heavily scripts everything they say and have a million people working on their image, that person is soulless
Can you look at a thing, and say with total certainty that its soulless, without knowing anything about the creator or creative process
Idk, soullessness is a pretty nebulous concept for me. When I'm exposed to some piece of media and I just wanna roll my eyes, that's soullessness
Alright so like
But you could say your soul itself there is not good lol
Well from my perspective that isnt soulless
Sorry *unoriginal
And be really excited about it
I think the "care" definition of soulless is flawed because you can make something soulless and original and shitty and bad and think "Damn I'm good"
Although as a result, the spirit of the finished thing is less similar to the spirit of a person than the spirit of a thing made by a smaller group
The more people you have involved in a project, the more it loses individuality, which a lot of the time is also seen as a loss in soul, but I dont think thats really the case. Its just harder to see when you have everyones individual effort put together
Also, one other thing
But its a pretty hurtful term to be slinging around because its one thing to say that about big production stuff but to say some person made a work that they didnt care about is ignorant
and money forces you to have to do stuff like that all the time
i think its like people do stuff cause they want to or cause they have to and stuff you do cause you have to is soulless like homework in creative classes or something
Whether ultimately the creators gave a fuck
And I think thats the heart of it
So a lot of cash grabs feel soulless but theres also a lot of other stuff that people just didnt really put much of themselves into
Thats fair
It has more to do with whether you care than whether youre doing it for money, because the consequence of doing it for money is that you dont really care about the work
I've said it before and I'll say it again: Caleb might be a serial killer, because there is no way you can play as lame as he does and not have blood on your hands
Don't listen to anyone who tells u otherwise
But everyone is flowchart
ABSOLUTELY
Yes
But theres absolutely a link there
do flowchart players play with no soul
No ones saying rich people cant make art some of my favorite things are made by huge companies
hilary clinton is like a flowchart smash player but in politics
Like Jeff Bezos does not feasibly need even a fraction of how much many he has
When you have too much of it
I dont think there should be this strong of a tie between soul and money
When is money not necessary
i guess a cash grab means cash you dont need?
Begging isnt meant to be art its work
Begging is done out of necessity, so it's not soulless
like begging is definitely not a cash grab but i guess its all done for cash kind of
Dang Barry with the soul list
In general sure but we should take it on a case by case basis
Hillary Clinton is soulless
Does it have to be not good, and also a cash grab
Metaphors exist I dont think anyones arguing literal souls
is begging a cash grab
That reminds me. The Big Bang Theory is absolutely soulless and its writers are all dead inside
But what does that really have to do with soul though
Are beggars soulless
Stuff like that I think fits soulless best even if individual artists/actors worked hard in the scene. It was unjustified by the art of the show itself
IE an episode of The Office received criticism where they go back to Dwights farm The purpose of the episode was to kick start a Dwight spinoff His family played a Decemberists song together at the end of the episode which was supposed to become the shows theme song But theres no feasible way this family with many intensely religious and motor skill incompetent individuals could play a Decemberists song together  So it was unjustified in universe and only made sense out of universe as an attempt to set up another big money show
ZDs Fox is actually soulless
It reminds me of when people say a game doesn't immerse the player  What a bullshit catch all term when a specific term would work better
Many people are soulless husks of flesh. I'm probably one of them myself tbh
honestly art generated by machine learning networks is kind of soulful lmao
Hit me doc
Andy I've got bad news for you
When I see the term soulless used best it usually regards a cash grab without any visible artistic intent
Pubg tho
I like the cell shading
But basically in any context when its used theres probably a more specific word
They all come from people
Fortnite isn't entirely soulless imo
I can see the soul in everything idk
Fortnite is soulless as fuck
Well the entire idea of a thing having soul is extremely subjective
Like isn't there a rule in some Japanese writing contest that forbids you from writing isekai because everyone fucking writes it
like things done for money or stuff to cash in on trends is pretty soulless
Yeah i actually trust Barrys opinion on this tbh lol
The furry artists of the past
which is why all the old paintings are like just rich dudes sitting in a chair
whenever art history was discussed in my painting class it was like yeah this guy painted portraits of rich people cause otherwise he would have no money and die
One of the best discussions ever had in brain expression
90% of anime/isekai
Thats what Im saying

I'm pretty sure trundle is Jesus
Show me some soulless art
Not basically
Isnt that basically Christianity
Now he's an asshole
But for real it's a thing I don't want to have to explain or justify but a lot of art is soulless.
The end
Trundle the true hero of runeterra
And so he decided fuck these clowns
U ugly
Damn
And then people were like
Same
I'mma take ALL the ugly dw
Oh didnt he like take it all
And he was like
Basically god gave his nibbas the ugly
Oh wait was he a literal martyr
In his old lore
He was
Srs
But I dont know what
Trundle is probably a martyr for something
"I'm the troll with the plan." Stfu you ruined the line by taking out the rhyme. Imbecile
New Trundle
And allen wins again
Solo cups
Yeah but what's really generic
I think generic is a better word for what some people are trying to say
And sometimes people dont like something or they dont wanna like it but they cant really criticize it technically so they aim for the soul
The components of a creative work are the technique and like the passion/heart/soul/whatever you wanna call it
My waiiifuuu
Yaaaas allen
Or rather to say something lacks soul is usually an underappreciation of technique and structure
What makes something soulless
But to go even beyond that
Most of the time soul is brought up in creative context its in an ignorant way
Cause who's to say any art is soulless

I hate this tweet
this is the soul of a solo cup
To put this conversation into context
Spot the soul

But Solo cups are pretty generic and the stuff that goes in them is more important than them
but solo is a design
No
Mugs can have their own souls since they can have designs and stuff
Have you thought about this before? Lmao
Goddamn
Its more of a vessel for soul
Loool why
A solo cup
Damn...
Paul
What is an example of something that is soulless
Until today because I saw a three star hotel had 4 star reviews and I was 
I didnt know hotels star rating isnt based on like reviews lol
There was 2d chess Then there was 3d  Now... OD Chess

Wait, 2.5 years?
Thats roughly the same amount of total time Ive been juggling julian with Palu up airs
Wait 2.5 years?
Thats roughly the same amount of total time Ive been juggled by Palu up airs
Wait, 2.5 years?
It feels like a longer time
but that made me realize I was only a student for a little over 2.5 years which sounds weird
last night I was thinking about how I've been graduated for longer than I was a NYU student
Got a lotta smash on your mind
I only woke up enough to get on my phone because Chrom did roy up b
Dang that's crazy
Yeah
Wait were you in bed
Woahh
I only had the game play
Who were you playing against?
Were you in bed visualizing yourself in front of a monitor
Thats pretty weird
And in a different color
Like I knew I was wrong about Chrom up b, but the incorrect up b still manifested itself
Woooah were you in a chair
Yeah
Did it look right?
It was really disorienting lol
So I thought I SDed but since it was in my head it made me do a blue roy up b
And when I was almost asleep I edge guarded snake and forgot that Chrom doesnt have roy up b so I up bd too far away
Yo I was falling asleep and for some reason I was playing Chrom vs snake in my head
I didnt think until now that since shield is bigger than your character sometimes either you parry or they miss
Good life advice

If your position is right you can go for parry safely
That's more than I can say
I don't always fail to drink
but your still half asleep right? and then you fall back asleep without drinking?
Sometimes I'm just thirsty when I wake up
I don't think it wakes me up
dehydration has never been so bad its woken me up before :/
and make sure your pee is clear
try to drink 7 cups of water a day
it seems your not hydrated enough
Maybe it's like I wake up enough to be thirsty but not enough to move
And then I either try again or fall asleep
And then I realize I'm still thirsty
I usually just don't wanna leave my bed is the issue
woah idk about that
Sometimes I wake up and I wanna drink but I'm half asleep so I immediately think I already drank
your water goes into your poopoo and peepee
do you guys ever struggle to drink water when you wake up dehydrated
how much you ate before
if you have nightmares
how much you dehydrate yourself through sweat or drool
also
how hot it is generally
Maybe how dehydrated you were before
what affects the variance in how thirsty you become while sleeping
or i could say this: https://youtu.be/n0mQzTDDD8w?t=184
Im playing 3D chess
I'm playing 4D chess
Like, what do you even say
And doing something really smart
Imagine actually playing 3d chess
And having this exact conversation
Imagine the developers of mega man thinking of ideas one day
Edwin
What would you name a robot character allen
Or is it
But X0 isn't the coolest combo
0 is the coolest number
Wait what am i saying
Maybe
Do we agree that X is the coolest letter
What's the coolest number
X4


P1 is powerful
E3
X5
B9
L8
K9
V3
Yup
C5?
Who is the beefy smashman
M8

Can't go fishing without some b8
AC-130
D1
G6
OH TRUE
B4
What more could you ask for
I think A1
Or anything else idk
C4
A1
What's the best number letter combination
That sounds like something someone would say to you to embarrass you but it works
Would the opposite be something like cupping your hand over your phone speaker to make the speaker louder
yo think of all the revelations smart people miss out on
I feel like I've done things like that before but I can't remember when and in what context
Like imagine if you thought to close a window to make it less cold without knowing previously that it would work
I'm shaking
Like my mind was so empty that it made a relatively impressive leap to common sense
So I felt as though if nothing was known about heat and surface area was known by society until this moment, I would have made some theory
wait so you poured egg into a pan and just expected it to cook evenly?
but there was no scientific knowledge in my head leading up to it
Like it's a pretty obvious train of thought
and in that moment I felt like Archimedes in the bath tub
thems shits are organic
And suddenly the thought that maybe it would be more consistent if I spread the egg out more evenly to begin with
eggs are uneven
Guys I was frying an egg and thinking about how my eggs always fry unevenly
Its in the cloud
Check wechat
Ahhhhhhhhh

Consumption?
Find the lie
Wait these arent true
Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.
1/4 of the worlds population has tuberculosis
Wtf
Tuberculosis was for centuries associated with poetic and artistic qualities among those infected, and was also known as the romantic disease.
Wtf
I didnt know consumption was tuberculosis
Keep my heart react tho
I misread that as Bowser
Oh BROWSER
Broke: this is my computer  Woke: this is Browsers Castle

But also fox is top 3
Although I think with tier lists people usually know its just one persons opinions they spent 5 minutes on so its fine
Because theyre so arbitrary except for the ones that are based purely on results but even those are weird because theyre determined by which players are good
Tier lists are so hard
Tier lists 
I feel kind of uncomfortable when people ask me what the best or worst of some things is
I try to stay away from saying things are better / worse than other things as well
I try very hard to say the former in general and feel free to call me out if Im not
Yeah Im just saying I wish more people would say the former than the latter
If that makes sense
For example if you say Krav Maga is more effective at injuring people than Karate, youre not saying its better, youre just saying its more effective at injuring people
Like Im not talking out the ass I know my philosophers and have opinions on them, and saying which is most useful in concrete practice isnt the same as saying one is objectively better
And I dont think thats unfair to say because its specific
Nah Julian I'm objectively the only important person in the history of mankind. I go into why on my new mixtape "Larger than average Chungus"
And thats generally not the case with the Eastern philosophy Ive read
But I do think that Western philosophy, with the big exception of Sartre, concerns itself with questions of why were here and what our job is and gets too heady to put into concrete practice
I watched The Pervert's Guide to Ideology and it was really interesting
I generally dont think any one thing is objectively better than any other thing
PURE IDEOLOGY
You had me at accent
It That Gets Left Hanging sent an attachment.
My favorite philosopher is Slavoj Zizek because I like his accent and the fact that he constantly goes on tangents and never gives a straight answer to questions and is self-deprecating and because this video of him exists
But at the same time sometimes more exotic concepts get overly glorified
For all I know that could be the case
I suppose for me it was less about identifying and contrasting trends and more about asserting that one perspective is better than the other
And it just didnt sit well with me
And it was interesting but I felt like it really boiled down to this is everything thats wrong with western philosophy, and heres why eastern philosophy is better
I only really push back against it at all because I read a book called the tao of Pooh that thao got me
I dont think we should avoid conversations because they COULD be bad
Then dont do it poorly and its not a problem yknow
But a lot of the time, it can be poorly done
In the same vein, I think you can have good conversations about how men and women generally approach different topics
im saying thats a trend/happens a lot
im not saying they represent all of them
Dividing them as such takes away depth and the point
Thats why to begin with I wanted to be sure to specify most attempts
I agree more with Allen though, even if there are trends with Greek and Chinese religions, they dont represent all of eastern and western
And I do think theyre interesting to talk about
There are things that are there
Its just recognizing that something is there and to not do so would be intellectually dishonest IMO
I dont think its generalizing if I can name off Kant, Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Sartre, Eagleman, and the Greeks and they all have that unifying principal
i think its less about trying to categorize systems and more like this is interesting so what does this say about other parts of things
I took a western philosophy class and everyone was concerned with what life means and what we mean to the universe
I dont think its unnecessary if its true
maybe i just think that generalization cause thats what i was taught
Its not the exact same but its the same principle of drawing a line somewhat unnecessarily
i guess its true but i think eastern philosophy wants to solve how to live life and western philosophy is what/why is life, like most philosophy systems we were taught from those groups are that
Not with that attitude
You cant compare and contrast individual men and women across history in the same way
Because we have a record of Eastern and Western philosophy and can literally compare and contrast point by point
Even if there are broad trends its kind of hard to articulate properly
Allen the west only believes in war and the east only believes in parents. How is that generalizing
Its definitely not
Its like men think like this and women think like this
I think its valid to recognize broad trends
Just Jordan
It generalizes both sides too much
*just andy
I disagree with most attempts at contrasting eastern and western philosophy
As time has gone on I've realized that whatever makes people happy without costing others any pain is just dandy
Im trying to see the whole navel
western philosophy is trying to solve all things logically and eastern philosophy is so chill
Philosophy is a tool-box, not a schematic to me
I don't know enough about philosophy to criticize it but I will anyway and say it's often too navel-gazing for it's own good
Meanwhile western philosophy can be cool but people just talk in circles when they try approaching it
A lot of Eastern Philosophy is just fire
But also to get rid of worry
Especially for control
That is so useful
But like the religion/practice is just exist
But Allens faster
I was
I wasnt going to say it

Thaoism
Yo Taoism/Daoism is broken
Well you can say trees are good for the environment, or something like that and while that might be subjective it isnt wholly dependent on human philosophy
Like we worry soooooo much lol
Most things are closer to just existing than worrying
whats not human
But I also try to keep in mind that the whole thing is extremely human
Personally I think of nature as zen all the time
Even and especially the concept of zen that we ascribe to nature
Well these are all human constructs
that we mass murder
why would they be at fault they are pure and innocent zen bois
Or are they at fault
*trees
Should we take example from tress
It would take too much energy to worry
They just exist
And how they dont worry about the past or future
I was talking to Julius about trees
Which could happen
Or they might be like yo cant wait til Im hungry again cant wait to eat more good ass bamboo
Unless they all adopt daoism
A panda would just be like my entire life is eating bamboo until I die so I might as well skip to the end
I wanna be a turtle
I do
I do
we dont go like yo im weak
Like turtles
Oh it would be okay if all animals had human thoughts
Also not all animals 
Yeah but turtles would be like,  yo Im slow whats the point
yea also theyd just be with their parents
Well they could
probably not cause they wouldnt think things like i cant be with my parents
If we gave animals human thought would they just all kill themselves
Leading to body dysphoria
Damn
Well the issue was he had human thoughts
but also id probably just be thinking things like caw caw
like i would probably just die if i was that bird guy
That kind of thing is the lifeblood of this chat
I've thought a lot about that kind of thing
Yup
Like a lot a lot
Like he has to eat a lot
I do
You ever realize how much energy beast boy expends per transformation
Then Beast Boy threatened the leader with consumption
All the kids are like yeah lets do this and the one dude is like should I kill myself
the SOOUUURCE
The aliens were the tofu julian
Was that just an episode of Teen Titans
Made up example but still
But then they are also like guys we gotta stop the aliens from stealing the tofu secrets
the only thing i knew about animorphs was that one kid was a bird forever
Artemis Fowl had some deaths later in the series
From what I hear Animorphs was like, beyond dark for a kid's book. It was... ADVANCED DARKNESS.
Like one of the kids is just constantly depressed because he cant change back and cant be with his parents
I remember it was really goofy for being so dark
how is there no animorphs movie
Forever
And then her chapter ended
The sentence literally read something like And then he killed me with a single blow lol
Like it might have been my first encounter with a direct death like that in fiction
I hear it was weirdly dark for a kids series
I was really shocked because I was a kid and she died in like first person
One of the main characters died in the last book
like when you dont watch an anime thats years and years in with hundreds of eps
i never read them cause there was so many
I read none of them but I liked the covers
I think I read a lot of the books
Anyone else read the series
I blame Animorphs for a lot of things
I blame Animorphs
But as far as I can tell its more like human form
So they think the word means like change into human
Like I feel people think it has to be nonhumans because they think the morph in the word means change
Well people dont often ascribe human qualities to human because its usually pointless but I feel like its fair to say humans are anthropomorphic
I mean definitions aside just how the word has been used
the 2nd definition
Anthropomorphic kinda implies the subject isn't human though
Or earth Chan
Like sinks
That wouldnt work because then it would branch to not animals

Oh
so it has to be not people
have you seen nazis
Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities.[
Does liking humans make us furry
not all humans have human characteristics
Isnt it just like saying cats are feline
this is too big brained
ALLEN NO
Because people are anthropomorphic right
I think they would more highlight the fursuit
I mean arent most people anthropomorphic enthusiasts
One who yiffs
I think they just describe it
I dont see a real way to get out of this one
I raised the question because I dont know of a good alternative
anthropomorphic enthusiast
I think they just have to buckle down and say furry
*you are*
Your favorite homosexual African-American art commissioner video game player of the year

Is there a more formal term for furries
Only a fool would fall for that

Did that come out
isn't there that batman ninja anime movie or something
batman be like    *picks berries*
I feel like they literally just wanted to make Batman a pirate and a hunter-gatherer so they made up a time travel plot
Remember when Batman was in like every historical period
wait jk he has no powers
batman should lactate
Flying dogs
Bats are great
And pretty lazy naming conventions
Well I think Batman has something going for it phonetically
antman
Those are very unappealing animals
Or Spiderman
What about BATMAN
Lol I already became mine
I've developed my evil persona in my mind already lol
How come mr freeze is a way better name than it should be
no i'd start a gofundme
Would you become mr freeze
Yeah I basically mean stuff like that
Mr freeze was a cryogenic scientist who's wife had to be put on ice and he started using the tech to rob banks to get money for her
Universal Studios rules were
Were any universal rules involved
Maybe Im the villain
I just called it off with someone because I thought it was for the greater good but she wasnt happy about it
Kingpin
Not when you go evil from bad things happening

or like your wife dying
wait is that like og comic thanos killing people to be like notice me senpai
for some greater good/goal
something thats so important and special to you it justifies wrongdoings
i think he means being motivated by some tragedy involving your waifu
What's a tragic waifu
Do you guys think youd be villains whose convoluted schemes are ultimately revealed to stem from misguided love for your tragic waifus if given the opportunity

Misclick apologies

wait so did deku see the previous holders of one for all while awake
and the chase sequence begins
you happen to realize it while walking down the streets of Manhattan in your dream
if in all of human history there was 1 actual new face in a dream
you know what would be hype
does anyone know how people know that
also, about the thing where you can't visualize new faces in your dreams
I thought about it more
Why did you remember
poetry
Well, i always appreciate an egregious absence of ceremony
like our minds can't make more than 7 types of fruit at once
there's probably a lot of specific rules we don't know about
At least from the scenes i remember
My dream environments are generally pretty vivid and detailed
If anything your dreams don't have graphical limitations
I think I was at a beach
isn't it weird that your dreams have like graphical limitations
Where were you in the dream?
wait I remember #2
I'm trying to figure out if theres some meaning or myself in the dream was a younger version of me
I had a dream where people asked me what school I went to and I kept answering with my high school for some reason
No
Allen do you remember why you might've said any of these lol
Gameplay also drastically varies
The each have a really different angle of story telling too lol
So they make for very different and interesting adventures
The goal of each route is to try to figure out why each one was said in the first place
Oooh that one is pretty fun
3
3
Your answer will decide the main route of your game
Which statement intrigues you the most

what have I done
Its not called 4 so using 4 is a cop-out
I gotta leave though I hear the sirens going wii-u wii-u
Winning that matchup you probably have to see in 3Ds

Project M.
In Melee, Marth Fox is SixtyFour-ty per se. Fox isn't able to brawl with Marth at the range Marth zones him out and ultimately, the chaingrabs make it so he could die as early as 4 percent.
Ill revisit this after I finish eating

You could probably make it work as a Lifelight lyric
Can you say every Fire Emblem subtitle in a normal sounding sentence
same time tomorrow i think we can crank this out soon
Good work everyone
alright let's keep it up
sixty four
Can you say every smash title in a normal sounding sentence
I actually say brawl alot rn
I wonder if I said brawl more often during brawl
Although you could make the argument that the current popularity of ult is making ultimate a more common word in my mind outside of attempts at surface level wordplay
I remember how many times I said 4 during Smash 4
Maybe you don't remember when you said ultimately during Smash 4 because it wasn't anything worth remembering
So maybe I really did just want to say it
And then I think back on how rarely I said ultimately when I was talking about smash 4
And then I go ahead because thats not a good reason to not say a word
I always hesitate because I think itll sound Im trying to use the word on purpose
I feel conflicted when I say ultimately while Im talking about ult
Yellow Pikmin be like   
Also because Yellowstone park

Because their ears let them hear the voice of their Pikmin god who demands blood in his name.

So yes

Well, it is on the floor.
It might be laying dormant

Next to Pac-Man
She's my only other elite smash character
Specifically at Housla featuring Paul
I've seen it with me own eyes
I refuse to believe
There is no way Yaseen has touched Isabelle
Me with Isabelle
But the instant gratification is 
Ganon is such a bad long term investment
Also Im not getting hit.
Wings of vi labbing?
I get back on like the 2nd and then I can practice with whoevers interested
Is this late january or early?
Its gonna be a valley after January housla tbh
No its a huge.mountain, but i think that mountain is different for everyone
That said its very hard to be at 10% against ganon
Dont get hit by dash attack nair or grab at 0-10
@Chris Colon
I don't get discouraged per se but they make me realize how much of a mountain it truly is
I was practicing combos on ike
Wait how
Lol
Yo I hurt my hands and shoulder practicing ganon last night
But more generally, I dont think I get discouraged by good people
Im not hurting my hands for her lol
With characters like Peach I feel like why am I bothering lol
I dont think getting better means you have to have less fun
And more importantly have less fun with it
I have this talk with Parecki at least once every 3 months because I feel as though he can be phenomenal but I don't know if he wants to put in that time
I feel that but more with specific characters
I feel like thats a personal thing. Like seeing allen and nick just makes me want to get better so i can be on par
Some people are wired to do better with that motivation but for me it just makes me not wanna even try
It's also really hard to keep yourself level headed when you see how much better some people are
Word
I thought it was 2 years lol
I got sophomores year mixed
Thats what i mean
The second to last year was still poppin
Eh the last year maybe
*hated
The last 2 years of smash 4 i was so ready to learn then everyone bmhatef the game
The most successful people never check reddit
That's when I learned I wasn't suited for it
But in the same vein that too much money is meaningless because getting it defeats the purpose of having money (I.e living comfortably), competing and working so hard for a win that doesn't make you feel good makes you more unhappy than anything
But I think the fact that I knew not to expect improvement without effort allowed me to not really be mad
Like for the second half of smash 4 I felt super gross about my play but I also didnt care enough to practice
I forgot what this fallacy was called
Yeah thats why I said if your frustration drives you to improve thats one thing but if you dont try to get better and are mad its just a perpetual unhappy experience
The most successful people just accept all the smoke and keep moving
I didnt say it wasnt legitimate
And yeah no that exists in every facet of life
Which leads to the shitty attitudes you see on Twitter
For all intents and purposes it's a lot of people's first experience with competition and the issues it brings
I feel like a bigger issue is getting mad at stagnation then not trying to change anything
I think what I learned was how much humility in dedication it takes to become good at something
I dunno I think getting frustrated at stagnating is legitimate even if the person in question is still a novice in learning how to train
But in so many fields if you dont reach a desired outcome, the test is still useful
The goal is to win
Like I get it though
I really hate it when people cant take losing
I guess it just depends on whether they do anything about it
Idk if thats helpful or not
Then some people always think theyre playing poorly
Which isnt good for improvement
About that though some people base whether theyre playing well or not solely on if they win or lose
My gratification is gonna hit in about 16 years
Like in general those without a sense of delayed gratification really suffer in this game, especially mentally, and it shows a bit in their life too
Im trying to dodge things more so I can only main characters with low crouches
Even though I barely played other fighters I think they help me with accepting things being more safe on shield in ult
This might be weird but I learned how much people addicted to instant gratification really fucks with them
Lol complain about things being safe on block
Also that
Or just space jab for 5 hours
Id probably SD and tweet about it
I feel like if I was ever put into a fight I would start playing lame and whiff punishing because of smash
which i guess really means i have a long long way to go before being ok to play anything competitively
Plus I would never have come remotely close to interacting with concepts of defense and pressure otherwise probably
like idk if i learned how to lose as much as i did that i cant take losing as a person
I like the idea of learning to take Ls, that something that only fighting games have unlike team based games
That too actually
unfit
i learned all the various ways in which im unfir for competition tbh
Sometimes when things go wrong it reminds me of losing in smash which helps me process it
So its kind of more likely to be blindsided by failure
I learned how to want to win
Learning to lose but also learning to learn
Humility
Since outside of some sports most people dont have a lot of opportunities to explicitly lose in life
I feel like its really useful for learning to lose
I lost knowledge
Nothing
What do you guys think you learned from playing smash
I want my spouse to live as long as they want to live. It's their life, and I don't want to impose or project my pessimistic view on life on them.
This is a tough question for me. I think life is suffering and the world is going to become an even grimmer place than it already is, but I have this weird hesitation to say that I want my spouse to die sooner
Kms rn
or anyone
or friends
wait theres absolutely no way id want to outlive my spouse lmao
My thoughts on this stuff go all over the place but at least I can keep it confined to this chat
I feel more and more that in most cases understanding is just acknowledging how much you cant legitimately reach with your understanding
I didnt understand at all
Then it happens to you and its like oh
Theres a lot of things you hear about happening to people all the time and it feels like you have a sense of what it feels like
I dont think its something I could reasonably attempt to understand in the present
Not that it would detract from the sadness, but its like the two of you went as far as you could go together, at least in this life
Like its sad, but I would think theres also a sense of completeness
I wonder what it must feel like
But at the same time its a natural inevitability
Its so sad when one spouse dies
I have no plans to die
Well I'm gonna live forever so it doesn't matter to me
But in general it seems like a tough call
I guess it would depend a lot on the person and your dynamic
This is assuming youre both already old btw
Assuming i love them enough to marry them, yes. Id rather be lonely then them be lonely
I feel like it sounds bad to say yeah, but if they didnt what if they get lonely
Would you guys wanna outlive your spouse
Are your dreams your reveal trailers
I keep seeing the smash logo in random places in my dreams
I woke up from that dream and was in another dream
Hopefully
Were we in the same realm
I tried to hurt myself to wake myself up but every time I tried my dream would force me back
it was a slightly wrong version of reality and I knew it was a dream but I couldnt wake up
I hadnt been dreaming much then I had an almost perfect sex dream with two coworkers I have crushes on and was incredibly bummed to wake up
ALLEN I USED TO HAVE THOSE EXACT DREAMS
So I remember that dream pretty well
But whatever I did was physically jarring / painful
Yeah there's certain feelings that dreams can evoke that are so visceral
Or wincing
And I woke up cringing really hard
I was looking at one and I suddenly realized there was another one behind me right before it did the beam thing through my eye
And sometimes a connecting beam / segment would form in between 2 of them
And there were some metal balls floating in the air
Like there was just no background
When I was a kid one time I dreamed that I was in this entirely white place like in movies where all the weird things happen
My dreams are really cinematic lol
But I'm not at the level yet where i can perfectly articulate it
There's a lot of cool stuff I've dreamted of that i reeeally wanna draw
But i wrote down a bunch to artificially remember them
You could be remembering the least cool ones
How do you know that
And i remember cooler dreams
I remember all the nightmares I've had when i was a kid
I mean from years ago
I've been having a lot lately
Or like whats your most memorable
Do you guys have really memorable dreams
Our invasive thoughts become invaders
Or if you start to doubt something, everything tries to convince you to doubt
Like if you see the sky in your dream and think about it being green it'll be green
It's crazy how because it's a dream, the stuff you think about while you're experiencing the dream becomes part of the dream reality
Thats the only real way to put it
It was like being in a genjutsu
And I started to doubt myself because idk why I wouldnt be able to wake myself up
Like I was convinced I had to be dreaming but everyone was trying to convince me otherwise
Well its weird because the entire reason it was a nightmare was because I couldnt wake up
And people were slightly wrong versions of themselves
Why was it a nightmare
It was like normal life except a bunch of small things were different
What happened in the dream
I think I had that a week ago
As in like you had a lucid dream sorta dealie mid dream
The way I thought about it within the dream was clearer but its harder to remember now
What happened
It was pretty weird
I had a nightmare where I knew I was dreaming but I couldnt wake up
Yo what if Leon was a cat
Creators should arguably take responsibility for the countless entities they conjure into existence for the sake of a shower thought
But then you have ones where everythings the same except everyone is a cat
Like its actually an alternate universe
Well like ultimate marvel isnt a gimmick right
What if the entire point of our own existence is some really jarring gimmick that well never know is unnatural
Alternate universes in fiction are fundamentally gimmicks
They're only gimmicky if you ask me
And also there are some pretty gimmicky alternate universes in fiction
Nihilism or solipsism
Doesnt that seem like the default world
Like imagine a world in which people say imagine a world in which Mango has a son
I think I brought this up before but sometimes I think about the universes for which were the alternate universe
what doesnt it have to do with killing piccolo and absorbing his body
Much like piccolo it makes me produce white substance from my peeshadeely
Wait what does this gif have to do with becoming Piccolo
Welp i know what i have to do now

Do you wish you could be Piccolo? I do
Piccolo can
I wish i could just subsist solely on water
Lets go water
Actually, we kinda have mediocre food in total, bar seafood   But the water is good.
How's the water
We kinda have shitty asian food ngl
it's my family so exclusively asian food
And what kinda food you like?
What 3 days???
@Justin Jones im gonna be in renton for 3 days, what are some good places to eat or things like that in seattle
No spoil
What if Suneater eats a person does he get human powers
Uh duhhh thao
do you ever think why can't i eat an arbys bacon cheeseburger and then shoot fire from my hands cause i think this a lot
Lunch rush
All i want for Christmas is you
Lightning definitely blows things up by over charging them
Imagine a Christmas MHA OC
Imagine a Christmas song being so good that it makes it into the canon
Heat is energy that is radiating, so something with such concentrated energy levels should be hot af
In theory it should
yea i think it'd turn hot
I ask this because one of my MHA OCs changes the phase change points of stuff and I wanted to know if he could make lightning lol
So the thing would turn hot
you mean like can it happen at room temperature or can the lightning itself be room temperature cause it's probably yes and then no
Like with an imaginary element
Can you hypothetically have room temperature lightning
probably not cause there's different energies you have to put into different atoms to move their electrons up i think????
Does everything become plasma at the same temperature
I've heard the phrase "It's not the voltage that kills, it's the current" before but I'm not sure it applies to lightning
like all your nerves and stuff and your heart and everything run on electricity
I forgot lightning was electric lol
But I don't remember exactly what it is
I think there's more to the danger of getting struck by lightning than just temperature
Allen about the original question, I remember reading a listicle about a guy who got struck by lightning twice in a short period of time
When lightning strikes does it just become not plasma
you can turn a thing into plasma but like plasma of one thing and plasma of another thing are basically the same i think????
I thought anything had like solid liquid gas and plasma states lol
Oh I guess I'm not plasma
Wait so do things not have plasma forms
plasma is electrons that have so much energy they separate from the nucleus
Like its a state?
I'm Plasma
But plasma isnt a thing right
it's plasma
I know this sounds really dumb lol
Is it made of what air is made of
Your son :(
I dont understand lightning
electricity is pretty important in your body but id say it's almost all the temperature
Or rather is the destructiveness necessarily tied to the temperature
Is lightning destructive / dangerous because of its temperature or is there more to it
Do Olympic divers every change their fall speed in the middle of their dives?
You angle your body down to increase fallspeed
Yes, but only when sky diving
Can you fastfall in real life
They are twice your age
The day you become as old as when your parents were when they had you
Its also hard to quantify peoples worth as a number
Realistically tho, i feel like finding ways to measure progress is important, but also that there is no one size fits all
Tho non-ironically I'm longing yaseen straight up. Massive upside potential.
I feel like a major cultural issue of america is that we are so hypercapitalistic that our culture draws us to measure ourself by book value like we are some stock
how much work/projects/things am i accomplishing and how impressive are they
i guess i meant like what my output is as a person
Capital?
Like what you own?
i track myself with capitalistic standards of worth unironically
My guy!! Lmao
Age 20 I was a virgin age 24 Ive banged in the double digits ayooooooo
But itll just happen
Yeah you thirsty to get big
But as a 20year old I'm sure it's just a product of the age
Exactly exactly but at the same time I do innately want to improve everywhere
It might introduce some unnecessary stress though. Self regulating constantly can trap you in your head
I see the appeal in that and I think it could work
And then adjusting aspects of your life based on how things go
My coworker brought up recording how you feel each week
Maybe yeah
Maybe you could track it with how comfortable you are doing certain things that you've been doing for a while
I have the gym? And besides that not sure
That chit is scary
I know a ton of people who track it to grades and I used to be like that
As of now I don't really know where I'd even want to track my growth
I might have it easier than some others in this regard because of my career path. Its super easy to track your growth as an actor but I imagine for other work it feels like your skill level plateaus
But I do see what you mean
I feel like if youre a mindful person you naturally improve in general over time
I know this is all in vague terms but I hope the point comes across clearly
But as soon as I incorporate one I feel the other one lacking
My current issue is that I'm always split between being better and being content and too much of either causes issues
Right right
For the stuff before, I think I know who I am and who I want to be and am pretty happy with both. Right now I just want financial stability without having to completely divert from my current career path

"who the fuck is scraeming 'SMASH 4 WAS GOOD' at my house. show yourself, coward. it was bad"
N3ver
I hope you thanked them for their service in making Smash 4
That's basically how I perceive myself
Once upon a commute I saw a large rat with patches of missing fur licking the bottom of an empty Doritos bag for the dust/crumbs as a train was like a minute away from running it over.
Currently? Ill get backnto you when grades are released. On average, average
I can't interpret that
Where xt is my self-worth
xt= -xt-1 + white noise
But this mindset seldom sticks before I fall into an extreme
I feel as though I'm closer and closer to reaching a healthy and productive mindset on who I am and what I wanna be
70 asshole
How do you all currently percieve yourselves
Im cool with 70 girls but they are a bigger asshole if they are an asshole
Just say they are a bigger asshole if they are an asshole but cool if their not
Damn thats so smart
Now who am I gonna watch
Anthony Fantano is dropping pacman :(
Now thats some big brain shit
Anthony Fantano 
This is just tru
But bald assholes are bigger assholes than other assholes
No bald people are cool
Is it because hes bald
I just thought it'd be funny to name someone completely innocent
Nothing
Wait what did VSauce do
I approach every pale brunette gaming YouTuber ranting in his room with caution
VSauce 
GyorgLopez :(
And nah i def consider it way too much
Every youtuber actually lol
@jontron
I actually never considered this
But like what if there not
When people say racist stuff I always assume there joking
Omg AP psych flashbacks
That one does look more fun
@Yaseen Mohamed

wait there was a discussion on double standards for short guys dating on a meme page and someone posted this LMAO
Also it would be hard to see it as one entity separated like that
3ds
Wii U
what if it comes out of the screen but in another screen
Thats crazy that its harder to see 3D in a 4D model
Actually idk If coming out of the screen works conceptually thinking about it because it would be hard to display the third dimension
We are one step away from making 6D visible guys lol
I guess sound for 6D but Id rather it be all visual
Because coming out of the screen would be easier to process
why does it have to come out before it has color
Have color for 5D
I just saw Sinji uair uair fsmash DKDan's Wolf in 6D
Actually wait it could just come outside the screen to be 4D
Probably would involve sound and texture
or like a gif
If they need 6D do they use real life
And we can understand its moving even if its not positionally from our perspective
Like the object isnt moving but a change in color would be so apparent and easy for our 2D eyes to process
I find that an interesting way to look at things
You know when math needs to have 4D models they just use color
As established in the no nut chat
Isnt that the universe that the current me is from
Only one direction is toward the truth
I didnt beat vi, I only did in the wechat universe
Since there are so many directions
I feel like you would need a multidimensional model to better quantify knowledge
Was beating vi a high or a low
It could be
If it is Im worried
Oh I thought that was like your knowledge over time
I have power
Look at this beauty

Nah I just forecasted college taught me everything
And college
Equal amount of incorrect things = elementary/middle school
I think Aluminum might be my favorite element.
My hope is that I forgot at least an equal amount of incorrect things, allowing me to break even
So much of what I knew has been lost to time
At this point me neither
Idk what that means
In high school I titrated a kiwi once and Thao titrated a potato
It's algebra on crack disguised as science
Gen chem is probably the worst class of all time
And I was already bad at bio
Like the more math there was in the science the worse I did
Chemistry was rough for me
I was just taught how those names work btw
Like how has Dubnium been there since 1967
Ununpeptium
I feel like every time I look at the periodic table I see an element Ive never seen before
Barry? Yum
I like Barryum
I like barium
Chlorine
Periodic table?
Different elements
Wait
Of the base 4?
Whats everyones favorite element
It isnt dense me think
Wait is aluminum good foil because it is dense or isnt
With height, i have a minimum cause under 5'3 i cant see you.lol to bring it all the way back
I think
Wait I got that backwards
Copper all the way
Fuck aluminum
Im generally not attracted to stick thin gals
lower density
I like some thicc
To an extent
Is heavier weight also more appealing because there is more girl 
I appreciate internal height
Tall girls seem appealing to me because theres more girl
Ive hooked up with a good amount of short girls and people about my height so I kinda want to mix it up
Bonus points
I adore short girls but height isn't that important
I mean if its fine with her its fine with me I guess
If a girl is taller than me thats fine
But realistically its w/e
Like I dont wanna say it doesnt matter because if someone was 4 or 8 it would be weird
So its unlikely for someone to be impractically shorter or taller than me
I feel like I dont really care, but that might be partially because be because my height is kind of average
Ive never thought about it but I guess I prefer shorter girls but I dont care that much
Lol Chris I was talking about my preference not the logistics
But I admit Im less inclined to make a move on taller people because Im intimidated or afraid of being turned down
So i haven't really thought about it
Julian I disagree
I feel like we generally don't have to care cause we're taller than most girls anyway
Also I have a threshold
Doesnt matter when it comes to bangin

How much do you guys care about height
I said it first
Julian said that lol
Just cause they're usually the ones asking
Well guys technically do get rejected more than girls
My brain is short circuiting I just napped accidentally
I think
Yeah I misread and somehow saw the latter in there somewhere
I just wanted to clarify that people didnt say that guys get rejected more than girls or that girls dont get rejected for height
Yeah its still relevant
So it's good
Yeah but julian was just bringing up an interesting example of a case that's related to this topic
Andy said theres factors besides height that guys get rejected for I think
I understood it
What you said makes complete sense in this context
Maybe I misread
It's a good point of reference
Nah he's just saying
Wait Julian who are you responding to
I have several problems with people being unattracted to Barry
Blah se blah, this that and the third
And shes very conventionally attractive
A gal friend of mine is 61 and shes had a lot of guys say she was too tall
I have no problems with people not being attracted to me
Blah se blah
If I gotta approach so be it
No that happens too
I used to think it was fucked and double standard blah se blah but fuck it
I think Andy is saying they don't just get rejected for height
But it's still true
But I mean that's just the game we play
And not by women but by societal norms
Yeah i know
Yeah
I think guys only get rejected more often because theyre put in the position of being initiators
I mean can you really draw an exact line though
Hard baseline
For me she gotta be cute
Esp on other people
Idk how attraction works
You can say that Allen but if someone legit is only attracted to 6'1 + people then I can't really say shit
Cause way more guys get rejected by girls for being unattractive
depth
lack of being a gamer
width
Cause there's obviously more things than just height that factor in to what girls are attracted to
like height
also most things shouldn't be absolute deal breakers
Now this is the context of when it comes to dating
It's just a hard talk to have
Neither is wrong and we shouldn't have these double standards
Like theres a difference between Im not attracted to them and Ew gross would rather die
You don't have to be mean, you just don't have to like everybody
I think just like dont be mean
Yeah choosing who you're attracted to isn't a bad thing
attraction is at least in some form physical at the end of the day
I don't think it's considered wrong either way
Yeah I feel like people can have preferences
Is it considered super wrong to have physical preferences?
what's your guys opinions on it being considered super wrong to judge women for their looks when it comes to dating or have physical requirements but girls also wouldn't date guys below ____ height or something like that
Loooool
but the more I look back the weaker the ironic element feels
And I changed it to Grief Rabbit eventually because it rhymed and for ironic edge
Greater even
The whole is the sum
but not what the whole is
I know what the stages are
you know my League name was Chief Rabbit

what even is grief
Like I opened the stream and was overcome with grief?
Grief notably has multiple stages
Is grief really the right word though
Grief
but in the back of your mind you know that realistically, they're likely to be early on in the run
or not necessarily expect, because you hope for more
also one component of it is that it's what you expect going in
Distraught?
I'd say it's about 60% disappointment, 15% sadness, 15% sympathy, 5% anger, 5% misc.
And some sympathy
So it's sadness mixed with disappointment?
it's a nuanced feeling
because you went in with hope for entertainment and they arguably dashed it
but possibly a weak sense of resentment at the runner
But you also feel sympathy for the runner because this must be immediately after their run died
Not only that, but depending on the game, the beginning is probably what you've seen the most / the most boring part
because as a viewer you want to see a PB or a world record, and the start of a run is the farthest thing from that
part of it is personal disappointment
and I'm trying to define the sensation
I've been thinking about how I said there's no word for when you open a speedrun stream and they're 30 seconds into a reset
That's definitely true
You cant even spell teemo without Olimar
Teemo was based on Olimar
Dont try to talk your way out of this one
Techies are what teemo was based on
Well i only say that cause no one really plays teemo any more
Techies in Dota are even more like that

So you dont play league
Yeah
I'm dead
If i step over a shroom, at least from what i remembered in like season 3
I meant getting hit by shrooms versus pikmin
Wait that's not what i meant Barry
Definitely not
If you think teemo has no agency, wait until you hear about techies
What about metal
If Olimar is invisible can you see pikmin
Cause you still have a good amount of agency with pikmin
Shrooms feel MUCH worse than pikmin
So its more like shrooms
I wanna say Brawl oli but smash 4 and ult oli have 3 pikmin
Oh my God
Most importantly theyre both captains
Ultimate oli?
Astronaut
Theyre like the same build and equally despised
Which one
Olimar is basically teemo
Young link still feels like melee
Teemo is the most league character
https://youtu.be/U996nO8zkZs
Lucario definitely feels Brawl other than aura being like rage
That was an entire era
Remember what does the Fox say
Cause he's so slow
Lucario actually feels very brawl to me tbh
What is fox
Greninja feels ultimate
Megaman and pac man feel sm4sh
The fire emblem characters feel sm4sh except for dancing blade
Kirby is 64 lol
Hitting in ultimate feels like quickly squeezing a balloon till it pops
Especially his down smash
Ultimate hits feel very specific
He hits like ultimate
He ding dongs you sideways
All his moves have that ultimate hit feel
Maybe metro tech 2016 should have used deshi basara
He feeels like ultimate tho
Also in retrospect
Idk hes like a rage grappler
Incineroar feels soo ultimate
all the pikas are pretty distinct
or melee
we will never have brawl pika again
pika is smash 4
Lucario and Incineroar are smash 4
Bowser Jr feels like brawl to me but Im not sure why
Ryu is Street Fighter
Peach / Daisy are melee?
Snake is Brawl
Like Chrom has melee energy and I guess Puff is Brawl
Which smash game do Ult characters represent
But if someone said objectively you know they're saying something is universal
If someone said subjectively you know they're talking about specific people
But i think we understand the difference
Such is a colloquialism
But we use the word and people get what we mean
It probably wasnt actually objective
Like if in the sentence you can replace objective with subjective and it still makes sense
Yeah i know
Yeah but most loose uses of objective are inaccurate
Cause you understand what i mean if i say death is objectively worse than amputation
Nah but we use objectively much more loosely
At least in the context of measuring distance to things
Also that could be debatable
You could consider basically any objective statement redundant
The distance between 2 points simply IS
Math is set in universal law
Cause it'd be redundant
So you can't really say anything is objective regarding a number of something
Units are math
Anywho
Yeah but their sense of distance probably doesnt involve the concept of units
And they're smart enough to gauge things
Dogs have a sense of distance
Far is inherently a relative word
But if i said something was objectively far would you know what i meant
Do dogs have any units
As many times and as many ways till you get to an understood unit
Units can be converted
Because I think it would be correct, but you could say a dog wouldnt agree
Units are math
Can you say objectively that place is 1 mile from here
Well on the Thursday thing
Cause if i couldn't use my arm my life would just be suffering
But objectively it's not
That's why i specified it would be subjectively worse for me to lose an arm than to die
But the line gets blurry because then people say objective to mean that their arguments cant be contested, when they can
But they would agree that 2 is greater than 1
A dog or an alien wouldn't think it's objectively Thursday tomorrow
So the safe territory is just stuff that cant be reasonably contested
But you cant really be certain that youre removing bias from your statements
Yeah that is valid
Oh I see
We only have law because people did research on it
*created it
Cause we pretty much discovered it more than created or
Objectivity is difficult because the premise is that its without bias
Not entirely
Well mathematical law is out of our control
We create objective thoughts
But in truth if we didn't decide on that then fuck it it's whatever we want it to be
Like   0! Is accepted to be equal to 1 and only 1
We accept them as objective no
Do you count social constructs as objective or subjective
I suppose
Tomorrow is objectively Thursday?
Is that math
Tomorrow is Thursday
Like
Saying 2 is objectively greater than 1 is kinda pointless
Cause that's redundant
Besides math stuff
What's an irrefutably objective thing to say
Subjects arent subjective
Facts are based on subjects
Cause worth is inherently subjective too
Isnt objectively like factually
Cause if i could give someone my skills and abilities that'd be pretty neat
I wouldn't unless i'm dying
Idek how that one would work lol
Can objectivity only apply to worth
Would you use baton pass IRL
Because its kind of inherently a subjective word unless you narrow it with context
As soon as you say better I dont know if it can be objective anymore
You transfer it to a separate account immediately
which $1 is the one you don't use cause it exists electronically only
That 1 dollar is subjectively worth more
but what if your dying mother venmoed you $1
The one dollar can be subjectively worth more
But if that one dollar was given to you by your dying mother or something
Well its objectively more
A million dollars is objectively better than 1 dollar
like i want to know what 25% of my capacity is and what that feels like
As in 2 is objectively greater than 1
honestly id use it just to feel the pain
An objective perspective and a subjective perspective are different i thought
If youre using objectively correctly
Doesnt objectively mean it cant be subjectively different
I thought you meant we can never be really sure
Ohhh
Which implies that you're below a quarter health
So subjectively it's not
Imagine knowing that you couldn't use substitute
How can you be so sure
Cause dying is worse than losing an arm objectively
So like if a piano were to fall on you you'd use it
Word
Like, I'd use it if i was expecting to get hit by something deadly
Well substitute is strategic in pokemon
You'd totally use it in smash
Pokemon
The way it works in pokemon or in smash
You have to withstand 25% of the total pain you can ever withstand but as a result the next 25% don't hurt you
Andy would you use substitute irl
Unless you got hit by a truck or some shit
Wait what
Cause you probably wouldn't incur more than 25% of your total pain capacity in one go
I thought about it more and the substitute shit would only be worth it if you were to die
Not me
Also did anyone read story of your life
Wait I need to unpack this
Yeah dude I love that frog
I mean
Imagine taking 25% of the total damage that could ever be inflicted upon you so that you could never feel that damage over time
And its called infinite dimensional cape lol
Like for extended periods of time
Where if you mash up and down in Mk down b he just stays gone
That sounds so cool lol
And if you hold shield the reappearing kick breaks your shield
In brawl there was a glitch / AT called infinite dimensional cape
But you hit him with an attack and he's just gone for 3 seconds
I stand by what I said
Not shadow sneak
The counter
No down b
Being in shield when Greninja uses side b is the least of my concerns
Cause it'd be reeeally hard to dodge it
So you'd want to hold shield
Well you usually don't know how long to wait for him to appear
Doesnt everything
It breaks shields if you hold shield
But it also does more damage
Greninja has a substitute custom that makes him take longer to appear
Would any moves in smash be better if they had more startup lag
Yeah
I think I also digressed though
Theres nothing wrong with running over people in GTA if it was just about them, but catharsis is fake so youre not getting rid of violent tendencies and the message you send is one glorifying violence
I agree, and thats an interesting discussion too, but what I originally meant was regarding the impact on the fictional characters themselves
What you do to fictional characters matters imo, but only because what you do to them can be indicative of biases towards groups of actual people.
Like in a lot of games I do pointlessly sappy stuff but its hard to define a moral code that encompasses that and also like LEGO games where you do technically evil things for entertainment
One reason its hard to be sure is because I think your approach can vary so drastically from one game to the next
IMO it's less about what you chose and more about why you chose it and what the game has done before your decision
Actually the more I think about it the more confused I get about what I think
But that doesnt sound satisfying either
But say, if a writer or a creator makes a character that they care about, then it could be morally wrong to write or otherwise depict harm to that character
Going back to GTA, again I think it would be silly to say that youre doing something wrong by running over random people
Maybe ultimately fictional emotions hold no value, but there is real value in the attachment that real people have to fictional emotions, which should be respected
But it's obviously representative of bad deeds
Because in a game for instance it does nothing
This sorta ties in to the whole morals being related to how you affect others and what you do having an effect on the greater entirety of mankind
I guess what I want is a way to be able to value fictional emotions and experiences without necessarily attaching any sort of moral responsibility, but that could be an inherent contradiction
This is the philosophy / discussion chat
But its hard to honestly say that without saying you should feel guilt / bad for like playing GTA, which doesnt seem right
uwu what's this?
Because when its framed like that, I would say its natural to say if it doesnt cost anything, why not make someone happy, even if theyre not real
Its a question I really struggle with
Human Wu's Father added Rahul Ramasubramani to the group.
To what extent, if any, should you have a moral obligation to press it
If theres a game and you can press a button to make a character happy and if you dont press it the character is sad
So for example
I got into a really heated argument online about this over ten years ago and I still think about it
Do you guys think fictional characters feelings hold any weight
yea i agreed with everything you said, i just wanted to make sure it was hispanic ppl
If its Hispanic people who champion it thats wayy different
It would be more awkward to convey a lot of information on a daily basis, plus I kind of feel like having a pronoun is part of your gender identity
like latina latino and latinx or the swedish hen
idk how it'd be worse to not have gendered pronouns at all but maybe 3 is the best
Or not just the language itself, but I guess is it better for people
kind of, the best would be having a non gendered pronoun also i guess
Is a language better if it has no gendered pronouns
sort of recent
it's not that horrible cause chinese people did make it themselves but like wow that sucks and it was so recent too
it ruined  and now it's hard for nonbinary people
I wouldnt say having a word for she is ruining things
white people indirectly ruined it for everyone
also for all the asian ppl did u know that  was gender neutral until the 1870s where they invented  to facilitate discussion between the east and west https://harvard-yenching.org/cultural-history-of-the-Chinese-character-ta
i mean like hispanic lgbtq people
i have 100% seen tons of lgbtq people have problems with the gender binarism with a ton of languages like spanish
Hmm when you put all of that on the table I definitely appreciate the word even more
also spanish itself is white people controlling how hispanic people refer to themselves already and latinx is made by hispanic people so i feel like it's reclaiming ways they refer to themselves
merriam webster also says it's "especially embraced by members of latin lgbtq communities"
i guess i exist within an educated minority especially when i was at school when i saw it all the time but i think it's definitely not a thing white people made for spanish people, spanish people made it for spanish people
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinx a lot of history and discussions on the wiki page
I didn't really know I didn't consider who wrote what I was reading when I saw the term
like ive basically never seen it used not by a hispanic person and im pretty sure it has origins with hispanic ppl
wait i feel like i see latinx championed by hispanic ppl all the time
Its a super unique story imo and I cant say a lot more without potentially intruding on the experience
http://www.kameli.net/~raimu/rnd/ted-chiang-story-of-your-life-2000.pdf
Ooo online?
And its also sci-fi / about aliens in case the first part sounds boring
Its an amazing story partially about language and how it influences your thinking
No
Oh do you guys know Story of Your Life / Arrival
Like it probably buffs your understanding of so many things
I feel if you can speak multiple languages fluently it does wonders for your perspective
But even then its a thought thats in Chinese but instantly considered from an English point of reference which is more 
My Chinese isnt good but sometimes if I speak it a lot I accidentally get like 1 Chinese thought which is 
Different
Speaking in and thinking in a language can make your entire world view so diffeeent
Language is pretty mind blowing
Persona Americana/ del EE.UU? Person is a feminine noun, but people is masculine, etc...
Im interested because Im only really aware of how English phrases evolve alongside contemporary culture but it must impact each language in its own way
Is it gendered
American person in Spanish
If you say like
That's if it gains any more though
As the word gains traction though I can definitely see Latino being a more frowned upon word
My take is that it's a good idea for a word but I think something less awkward should be put in place, and we also shouldn't shame anyone who uses the word Latino because it's been assumed to be the go-to for a while
But even that's a little ambiguous
I heard of using the phrase Latin instead to cover all cases
Like probably the exact definition of it
This is literally cultural appropriation
The former
Should I be reading it as latin-x or "la tinks"
It kinda hits me with the white feminism vibe
In theory yes, but i personally think that the culture should come up with the word themselves
It has very good intentions behind it
It does seem like a concept that should have a word
Yeah I can see that
I think externally changing how a culture is referred to, especially when they refer to themselves that way, perpetuates a sense of power dynamic over the culture itself
Damn I never appreciated how simple it is that most ethnicities just have a neutral noun
Then i think no.
Only an educated minority is considering the word
No I don't think so
I feel like it had very good intentions though I'm not sure Latino as a term sparked any sort of issues with the LGBTQ community
Is it a term originated from the cultures of which it speaks of?
Apparently "Latin@" was used in writing about 2 decades ago for the same purpose
It's a somewhat new term, it's meant to replace "Latino/Latina" as the gender neutral term to cover both genders + any other genders
What does it evolve from
I dont.... whats it mean?
What do y'all think of the term "Latinx"
You just gotta meet them half way
Like theyre there because they want to fall in love with characters
I think most audiences are on your side
Theres a lot of challenges in story telling but on the bright side a lot of times its literally the simplest or smallest things that can endear a character to an audience
Making someone fall in love with a character AND being able to portray a message without coming across as being preachy both sound like really difficult tasks
But when you express it through stories and characters theres more distance and ideally you can think yeah I want to be more like this character or yeah I have this flaw too and I wanna work on it
Because if you just tell someone to be a better person they might feel defensive no matter how you word it
I think fiction is a great medium for looking at morals and self improvement
Just put it out there and let people engage with it if theyre interested
I want to be able to share what I think about these things with the wider world without trying to force it on them
Thats part of what I want to accomplish as a writer
ESPECIALLY self-awareness
Yup yup and I'm sure finding the balance is something that comes through a lot of trial, error, and self-awareness
All much easier said than done
Maybe a good mindset is that so long as you have energy for it, its a good thing to try and steer people in the right direction, especially if theyre people close to you, as long as you can do so without judging too harshly or being too narrow minded in your beliefs
Yeah exactly and how much does that damper the rest of the good things (i.e. why we're friends)
How many friends would you do it for
Like if your friend told you they litter would you try and lecture them about it
And the energy and time you have are finite
Its complicated for sure
There's levels and you just have to intuit when to step in I guess, if I were to boil it down practically
Which again leads to the whole "being just vs. being pretentious" dealie
My friend recently made the argument that if you're not correcting these types of things with people you call your friends, then you're not a good friend
I just do it less now I think, and I dont know if thats better or worse
Well its not like I went from 100% to 0
And I dont know if thats being less uptight or if its caring less
And now I might be more likely to just not address it
But the logical extreme is obviously terrible for my life
Like to put it simply I guess in the past if someone told me they were doing something they shouldnt I would most likely say they shouldnt do that
A lot of times I like to think of the "right" thing to do as the one that benefits the world as much as possible
IE self defense and other more complicated situations
And specific context can be layered on top of that
Because you probably shouldnt go around telling people how to live their lives, but in many situations choosing not to intervene or at least comment could just be the wrong thing to do
I think a good basic parameter is if the action taken hurts anyone
Thats a good way to put it I think
I like to think that there's always MY actions to prove where my moral compass lies. But then one could argue that not shaping someone to be "just" is immoral
Balance is best but finding the balance point can be hard or impossible
Its hard to say
But at the same time, does that mean I wont have conviction or a solid moral compass?
And I dont want to be too certain that my ideas of right and wrong are correct, because they could easily not be
Like people might do things that I disagree with, even heavily, but maybe the factors of their life and upbringing makes it more understandable from their perspective, which doesnt necessarily justify anything but I try to at least acknowledge it
I try to have more perspective about things now
Dunning-Kruger comes in swinging every single time I feel as though I have an aspect of my life figured out
Morality would just be one of them and I too tend to place it very highly but you're right it can be to a fault
I think there's so many ways you can view anything, be it situations or people, that the "correct" view probably just has a lot of different aspects
And conversely being critical of what I disagree with morally
Sounds familiar and I can definitely see how that can be taken to a detrimental extreme
Well its still me too but I guess I mean it as valuing what I consider to be doing the right thing highly
Define moralist because hot damn if that doesn't sound like me right now LOL
But for better or worse I chilled out
I think I was more moralist as a teenager
I just pay less mind to the small nitpicks I have
That said it didn't change how much I value the little things people do that are good
Yeah for sure, I used to be super uptight about lil petty shit until I realized how pointless iit is
And it can gradually snowball from there
Its kind of easy to let little things negatively affect your opinion of people
It being perceived character flaws or reasons to judge people
I think the majority of the time, its not that bad
If something really doesn't damper who you view a person and how you interact with them then it's not all bad
And it's equally important to remember that flaws are only as large as you perceive them to be
At the same time though some things are legitimately minor personality traits in the grand scheme of things
Luckily that tends to just attract people who think the same way
Especially when its presented in a deal with it way
Yeah I really dislike the whole "being (objectively bad personality trait) is just who i am" sorta thing a lot of people say
Confidence and positivity are great so long as youre careful not to be too stubborn about working on your faults because theyre part of your identity
I think in terms of being yourself, like with most things theres a healthy balance
And also one that submits to the other person
Also in addition, saying you wanna be someone else comes with this subtle acceptance that someone has it strictly better than you which is a depressing thought
I think its kind of insane how little we really understand about other peoples lives
Well that makes sense on account of how you understand the upsides to your life way more than that of another
But also when I think about it more, I feel what I want is for the me that I am to be better, not actually to be someone else entirely
Like I certainly wish I could do a lot of things better and be a better person in a lot of ways
I mean a lot of the time I feel I dont want to be me
Which i hope to extend onto things smaller in scope
No that makes sense esp the whole your life belonging to you part. It's just all an extension of only thinking about and accepting productive thoughts
It just extends beyond time
Its kind of the same thing for iterations of life I guess
But there is a sense that this is the time that belongs to us and that we belong to this time
When you put it that way I think a good number of people would want to do it actually
But would you want to take back your life if it meant living 200 years in the future, even if the future was guaranteed to be a better place?
It feels way better to be alive now than to have lived say 200 years ago
Like this life is objectively not perfect, but because its the one thats yours and that you lived, youre attached to it
And I think that highlights the idea
Well I think about that sometimes because a lot of people who are happy with their lives say they wouldnt want to change anything, even if obviously their lives are perfect
Unless you think differently lol
It's probably not the case that whatever iteration of our life is the best one but it's in our best interest to see it that way
It's weird to think about the alternate universes because by definition you can't access them
Human Wu's Father changed the chat theme.
Even if all you do is live and die, I feel like it could be enough, and all this media and everything is a nice bonus
If you consider the other lives you could lead or even the different universes you could lead those lives in it would be arrogant or naive to believe the one thats yours is better but from the perspective of a little bit of matter in the cosmos I feel content with the range of emotions and experiences I get to feel
I really feel though existence can feel like a hassle in a lot of ways, it also really is a privilege

But the fact that these things only matter to people make them feel like concentrated humanity
Because in the context of the natural world they might as well be meaningless, and in contrast they can make people feel so strongly
Omg the concepts of beautiful prose and the significance of names give me life
So thats what I think you could get out of the novella that you wouldnt from the movie
For context its considered an example of really strong / beautiful prose
https://www.pf.jcu.cz/stru/katedry/aj/doc/sukdolova/Truman_Capote_-_Breakfast_At_Tiffanys.pdf
Gotcha if I read it over break I'll report
The pdf we read together is only 25 pages
And its actually a novella, so its not long
If you are, the full text is online
Interesting I'm def interested now
Like they have different strengths as a result of being inherently different mediums, but I think at their core they get the same emotions / themes across
Theyre both really good
I never read the novel how does it compare to the movie
Breakfast at Tiffanys is actually one of my favorite novels
Heart react if the girl on the right is just as beautiful as the girl on the left

And I got a picture with a wax Audrey Hepburn last month
I really appreciate square ball jazz as a phrase
Like not immediately before
I also watched the movie before a breakup
We read at in housla literature club
Next to Kricketune or some shit
Honestly #1 cry of all time
I watched the ending after a breakup and cried
Wait Breakfast at Tiffany's?
Even the wild ones
They only have a name since they captured
Nothing has a name
Omg everything is connected
@Chris Colon this all ties back to the cat in breakfast at Tiffanys
Its confirmed Pikachu says Pikapi when talking about Ash because it rhymes with Satoshi, his Japanese name
Of squad strike
I guarantee your mission wont last 2 games
Ima make it my mission to never hear it then
And itll be true
Im gonna say that every time Nikita kills
Btw
Nika

Pi is in pika
Pikachu sometimes says pee instead of pika
At the very least they clearly understand speech
So maybe they can all talk
And its not really treated with an extreme amount of surprise in the anime
But like, there are Pokmon who can just do that
I think that makes sense except it implies Pokmon could all just talk if they wanted to
So maybe once humans name them they adopt the sound
But they also have the capacity to make other sounds
We know Pokmon can make more or less regular animal noises
Okay how about this
I mean does Felicia kill people or does she like KO them lol
Which also reminds me, earlier today I was thinking its funny how much blood is on the hands of the most peace loving FE children compared to like the most violent real world people
pokemon are like lovecraftian entities
Or did it coincidentally learn its name
Did we know what it said
Existential crises aside the Pokmon universe seems pretty terrifying
How did we know what to call Kabutops before we revived it
Not even just the word but the concept
Did trash exist before the trash Pokmon
IE the word leaf did not exist before someone heard a leafy dinosaur say Bayleaf!
But in universe, you basically made up a Pokmon name
Like imagine making a pun or a portmanteau casually
Maybe we based our first language after the sounds Pokmon made
Like either humans are somehow responsible or our language stems from Pokmon?
Did humans discover language or Pokmon first
Its really troubling
Thats what I meant with the geodude thing
And then it forgets how to do so once it grows up
Like what are the chances of a creature only being able to say the word Squirtle unless humans are involved somehow
Wait that theory makes Pokmon sound like It lol
Or the world itself
But yeah based on Pokdex entries brains might be broken
Or telling a story in different languages is each a slightly different, separate thing
Like there can be a theoretical true story, and any language you experience it in is viewing that one story through a different lens
Human brains in the Pokmon world might be broken
Based on the Detective Pikachu trailer maybe Pokmon speak our language but our brains cant comprehend that so we rationalize it as the first thing that comes to mind when we see them: their own name in our language
Well it depends on how you interpret the concept of stories I guess
I think its reasonable to consider different translations of media to be separate realities
is japanese pokemon like an entirely different dimension from american pokemon
I imagine that within instances of the Pokmon world the sounds / names are consistent
like pokemon speak languages
youd go to other countries and the animals/pokemon there would make entirely different sounds
Like is anything real
in viet the sound a cat makes is the same word for cat but thats not true for dog
Not to mention I think Id be really confused about the nature of the universe if there was a living thing out there going around saying geodude
i guess only cat and dog are like that
like what if a pokemon made a new sound no ones ever heard and then you had to change its name
Assuming not all Pokmon make noise it must be really strange taxonomically to name Pokmon unless they just dont bother aiming to conform with the patterns established by their natural utterances
Well maybe not all
All Pokmon are named after the sounds they make though
Because the components of mao are like dog grass field
And if anything the Chinese makes less sense than English
Like even for cat theres a different word for the sound a cat makes
I dont think Chinese animal words are like that
like animals are the sound they make but in english they're some weird thing
i like how in asian languages cat is like mao like the sound a cat makes but why is a cat cat
Human Wu's Father changed the group photo.
But when I hear a frog ribbit I think the noise sounds like the word
Like if you see the word meow you think yeah thats a pretty good approximation of the sound cats make
Or one is more prominent than the other
For all onomatopoeia either you hear the word more or the actual sound more
I was just thinking
It might phase out in 100 years
I dont think anyone knows
Yeah but I never thought about it
Babble makes sense lol
And babble
And knock
Like I didnt know cough is one
Theres some really surprising onomatopoeias
Fucking evolution
Theyd probably die again
What if I brought the dinosaurs back to life
Someone say something to continue the dispersion
I can't wait to see how this Butterfly Effects
So maybe there was a reason for me to accidentally say that
Some philosophies say there are no such things as mistakes
I am the shadow the true self
Wrong chat Im tired lol
I feel bad for all the secondary guy characters
I get that feeling a lot but it usually gets better if I see friends every few days
if you don't do stuff when you get home as an adult tho then you feel like your life is stagnating and you never feel like that as a student cause you're automatically progressing in life
L I ' L B O M B E R?!
Bad Company?
Or small bullets
The guy was wholly crazy so it's possible

http://mentalfloss.com/article/73890/retrobituaries-diogenes-sinope-ancient-philosopher-who-lived-wine-barrel
It's bc they're all frat kids
These Greeks lived wild
goals honestly
My boy Diogenes lived in a barrel while ranting to devoted students and had lots of sex in the same barrel
I refuse to read
Yo y'all should read up on the actual Greek origins of the School of Cynicism
The understanding that you have agency in how things go and that you should get to things/not complain about the crummy things you can change, while becoming accepting of the things you can't
What that
I been reading a SHITTON about stocism and that shit is incredible
I'm here for a good time and a good time
I'm here for a long time and a good time

Where my :thinking: at
You cross that bridge when you get there
*really be
Can it really my maximum pleasure if consequences do hinder the maximum
I dont 
TO AN EXTENT
I like that
Maximum pleasure with 0 regard to consequences baby
Interesting
Hmmmmm
I.e. food, sex, money
Relishing in "worldly" phsycial things
What's hedonism
Moral of the story is hedonism is dope
Why would I be happy, someone is happier lol. Its like how you cant be sad because people are sadder lolol
Moral of the story is gotta be happy no matter what
It's just not a good feeling but it comes with it's own plethora of upsides
And then there's the subject of applying to shit
If you have any work due then downtime feels like you're procrastinating
At least with work Im not wasting 72k
What responsibilities do you have rn that you're ignoring
If Im having fun Im not doing what im supposed to
But at least you're more allowed to
In college it just feels like Im ignoring responsibilities
But they feel huge
They're not actually huge
I just hate having seemingly huge obligations every time I come home
Being in school is being with friends all the time with pretty low responsibility
Like what
But fr some parts of adult life seem rad
Maybe school was just that bad
Some Aspects Corp.
I can't wait to work in some aspects
Like you answer a phone, and have fun? Boy thats just crazy
Thats rich
Than sent one with it at 12:22
Yo I gave that in 11:56 pm w/o bibliography
My mom does. Shits wack
some people actually like work better than school not factoring in money and that's crazy
I just want enough money to get streaming equipment
Im gonna flame you until i know its done btw
Ideally, your essay due 2 days ago 
But like I need to do something
as an adult, fuck i wish i could be back in school
Like I know ima hate it
Honestly, i can. Fuck real life
I cant wait to work ngl


i look at the funds and think wow this line looks nice and then i put my 401k in it
In general, a certain portion of your paycheck is withheld and invested in a retirement plan if you have it through an employer
No my dad told me which funds to do
One of my jobs raised us to $15 an hour which was cool but then the whole state did that like a month later lol
401k
Watch out for that shit they put it in a fund that can fail lol
LMAO CHRIS AND I ARE ON OUR STERN SHIT
401k and 401a
Omg your 401k
Matched 401k?
I still don't completely understand retirement contributions but I also have that
Also tho, fuck big employers who dont pay enough to save
Got that insurance 
Not accounting for unforseen circumstances
Like in an ideal world you should have savings for about a month of survival jobless
Yeah thats normal lol
Thats what you are supposed to do
I put aside some of my paycheck each month in case I somehow lose my job and cant pay rent for a while
Same tho
I would, if I got a job lol
But yeah paycheck to paycheck is like, each paycheck pays a bill due that week
Chris i think you on average should have a higher starting salary than me and ill graduate with a masters LOL actuarial science is od
Like a good job lol
Show up to interviews in cutoff suits
If I get a job lol
chris are you about to be rich when you graduate
Bra I didnt think people actually saved money until NYU, that idea was so foreign to me and I take finance classes 
are savings real or myth
If you miss one you would probably lose your house/ get kicked out of the apartment/ lose the lighting or something
You die
Yes
You cant miss 1?
So like what is like not paycheck to paycheck
He had a data cap too :(
See I dont even call it wired connections because wifi is so engrained here
Im exposed
I used to play games with a guy on satellite internet in the middle of nowhere
Whats crazier is the number of people who dont have wired connections
some people make a bajillion dollars and live paycheck to paycheck
I forget that at NYU sometimes
Thats crazy
Ya know mad people dont have wifi
Legitimately
I mean, something like 75% of america lives paycheck to paycheck
I mean actual survival
Nah most people who are living worse than paycheck to paycheck get there money by other means usually

Damn I suppose survival is inherently unsustainable
Live is like everything still functions at least
Survive is like a little less than paycheck to paycheck
Or less
How much more money do you need to live than to survive
Rich vs Wealthy though that's a wild conversation
I said live
Nah I didnt say survive
also i guess it doesn't apply to students but like being rich vs coming from a rich family
That's rich
When your name is Richard
Rich is when you can send your kid to NYU outta pocket and not feel the impact
And I was chillin
Rich should be way more than twice what you need to survive lol
When I was 10 I made $0
I mean, my mom could do that and we aint rich
Rich is like we could cut half your paycheck and you still can live
I love inflation when the minimum wage doesnt keep up
"stop buying Jordans bro haha like I swear after I read Des capital I really started to hit it big"
Nah thats like go to college
Cause if so FUCK
Is "just edgeguard him" the equivalent to "buy more money"?
My budding high tier
@Yaseen again cloud
me tbh
Then you're rich
Also Ill redefine, the $20 every dinner while also buying lunch, after paying rent/mortgage by yourself
If you have to go on a massive rant about why you're not actually rich at some point
Rich is also super relative
So like, 100k in NYC is different than 100k in boulder
One of my friends is pretty middle class here then he goes back to India and hes suddenly loaded
Well off is anywhere between like 100k (adjusted for local) to that imo
Rich i would define as like, an order of magnitude over average pay
paul living in bumblefuck :(
So they own land and shit
Most people in America make dick money but live in bumblefuck
should've made cotton candy at housla
But you gotta remember how most people are in America
Rich cotton candy I might add
How about defining it as someone who can efficiently make cotton candy for a lifetime for just a one time purchase of $15
I make 5 figures which is not rich and i can afford that lol
It's just a bad idea
But someone on a 35k post taxes salary is probably doing that without any real threat
You might be rich
Nah you just manage money poorly
If you can buy a $20 dinner every night without much impact youre rich
Wealth has so many levels to it
You're doing very well though
I feel like if you gotta worry about how much shit costs and you can't just drop everything and be chilling you're not rich
I wanted to say 6 figure is rich but thats also a huge area
i definitely try hard to not identify with the label even tho i have a 6 figure job like am i rich/wealthy????
Youre onto something
Is rich equivalent to wealthy because in my mind it's the tier below
i feel like no matter what, no one identifies as rich cause the label is vilified so theyre like oh no rich people are like jeff bezos and not me
To consistently go or have some kinda season pass tho
I said plural
The same thing tbh
You can go to a broadway show without being rich
Whats the smush version @Allen
If you go to broadway plays 
When Cloud mains talk about mus
guys how do you define rich
boobs are less evenly sized cause they're close to your heart and your left boob is usually bigger cause its closer
I assume it goes to whats active
And I hope no one is ever in a position to find out
Wtf my bodys brain is bigger than mine
I really don't know though
Probably distributes it based on necessity
Oops didnt mean to click that

Does your body distribute that evenly or does it like go as far as it can and stop lol
But if you dont get enough nutrients
Okay this is gonna sound really dumb lol
Legally
I don't think I'm allowed to answer that
Technically you only need one boob to breastfeed
Thats a valid point but does my family tree really not think boobs are the most crucial part of the body
My goblin touches my boobs at night
As opposed to one leg being much  bigger than the other
This is a really simple-minded conjecture but maybe, on account of natural selection, it makes sense that your family tree could get away with having the less crucial parts of the body growing unevenly
Maybe a goblin stretches us while we sleep but is shy about touching boobs too much
I guess that raises the question of how much of your growth is even determined by nurture
I dont know anything but my guess is that there wouldnt be some kind of mechanism that keeps your leg growth even, but in general they get the same resources and go through the same stuff so they should end up around the same
Maybe theyre harder for the body to make consistently
Eyebrows are also different from one another as well
And like that makes sense but I wondered if it applies to all body parts
Thats true
Lol I started wondering this because someone said one of Christmas Cecilias boobs is slightly bigger and then someone said boobs are rarely evenly sized
Lmao google says scientists dont know
If someone has one leg abnormally longer than the other did something go wrong biologically or do they actually just grow at independent rates?
I dont know but I had a dance teacher with one leg slightly shorter than the other
Is there anything that makes your legs / etc grow roughly the same length as each other or is the variance just so small that it works out
I wonder how ancient norse people would react to seeing a sequoia. They'd be like, "Omfg, there's more than one Yggdrasil."
I like my trees like I like my boys. *B I G*
The Andy Bow Effect set the nickname for Barry Tessler to Professor Sequoia.
My favorite tree is probably Sequoia
Or I guess it was an accident if you just noticed it now
What's your favorite tree barry
explain mewtwo
Yeah barry probably
I am
canonically
who is like in charge of the pokedex order
So it's placement in the pokedex is dubious as it is
Cause only like a couple people have actually seen mew
cat*
I like that mew is a cart
That mew might not actually exist
It adds to its mythicality
I like that nothing about mew makes sense
I know but I just never noticed that until you brought it up
this isn't a laughing matter it makes no sense
the fact that mewtwo is before mew makes me angry
Inkling is top 10 in my mind but idk where
Or if the game was new
If the cast was 500 characters and excruciatingly balanced then saying a character is top 10 is way more ambiguous
It's also due to the cast and how obvious the standings are
Mewtwo is barely top 150
Top 10 but but not top 5
It's sort of evolved into that yeah
or rather it goes without saying
Rahul said Mewtwo is top 10 but in the lower half and I thought isn't every top 10 char in the lower half
are there 5 or 10 characters that are top 10
Yeah it is
It's still going on I think
I miss that show
Find out if thats me next semester on Total Drama Island lol
I definitely procrastinate talking to people and end up never doing it
Actually though lol
also ghosting is legit related to procrastination anyways
if you tell someone i feel like they could want to argue about it and why you came to that conclusion
i didn't see this until now but yea reaaaally trying to avoid a fight/discussion on the issue
So ya gotta do like Danny Phantom
A lot of people are very unreasonable
Because you avoid the confrontation
If you ghost them they hate you anyway
Wait why would it be bad
*cool but
I usually go with something vague like "You're really cool I don't think this is working out as a romantic thing "
idk i feel like every time i ghosted someone, if id said what i thought it'd be sooooo bad lol
I think people being wishy washy is generally either  A. Still feeling it out but leaning towards no B. Too polite to turn down yet
Ah the mention of topics confused me
Ghosting
Wait are we still talking about dating I'm confused
I'm very wishy washy in general but I think it's because I see myself as uninformed and would rather learn first than be wrong first
Baseless conjecture though
Ive noticed less people having opinions on things and being very wishy washy on topics, I feel like it leads to them not doing anything until they feel like they need to ghost
Imagine people saying what they think
I'm just saying it's not a good practice if being transparent would solve the issue
That doesn't seem like ghosting if you already said it wasn't working right?
Yeah no if it's good for you and serviceable for the other person to get the point across it's fine
I feel bad but at the same time I already said it wasn't a good fit

I've ghosted people and I'm definitely currently ghosting someone
Again VERY case by case
Whether or not the other person's feelings should be taken into account is based on your moral standing and what the other person has done but I think it's a terrible thing to leave someone to their thoughts
Its a tradition Allen
Chris ghosts me on wechat on a monthly basis
I just got bored, instead of one case
I've never been put into dire situation so take this with a grain of salt, but I'd say that many if not most cases of ghosting are cases where transparency and bluntness regarding ones feelings would serve the other person way better
Still, no shame
Not all lol
Were they bad man
Is that bad
Ive only ghosted men
Thats on them, not me
Its not my business why they didnt follow up I think
Ghosting sucks but if I did anything to make them feel uncomfortable or unsafe Id understand
theres too many and you can never get rid of them all
idk if its appropriate for me to reference tess's deadname but its actually the law of conservation of sams
Depends
Things not working out isnt a personal attack its usually situational
But ghosting isn't rude?
Dang that's wild
Unfollowing or unfriending can be seen as rude and some people dont want to do that
Imagine if that's how that worked
and now we're frens
i also matched with someone and then they immediately told me they were trans and their name is now sam lei and this was like the same time tess was coming out
Its so weird that these girls that have ghosted me didn't unfollow or unfriend me
But why the friendship works well
You and Robert are the same person which is why yall could never date
he came to a housla once
and then i got rejected before asking him out but hes still super cool and we are frens
this was like over the summer
i wasnt that into him but then on the first date he said men are trash and some other sjw/feminist/socialist things and then i was super into him lmfao
yea i half met julian's friend robert on a dating app
Oh is that dr Bob
yea so like really 1.5 people
Dr Bob
i have befriended 2 people from dating apps though, sort of
i think ive literally never been on a second date with someone i met from a dating app
We're a week in and people aren't even that mad
Just the idea of getting to know a girl and trying to court her just sounds so mentally exhausting right now after investing so much time in those 2 girls
Ult is a disproportionately wholesome game
Ult would turn anyone whole
but it was so pure and wholesome he just wanted to play ult
it was actually really refreshing cause almost every interaction ive had with a guy that resulted from a dating app was just they want to fuck and thats it
Oh wait I sent Paul
In fact I haven't sent anyone to it
Also I got sent there instead of making it
and then he left his gc adapter at my place so now i have one for tonight
There's only 3 people in it now so it's kind of quiet
you could have send him to ultimate shadow realm
Hot
i met a guy on hinge and then he said he was a competitive melee player and he came over to housla to play ult and then i falcon punched him
I hear Hinge is better than Tinder
I hope that decades after NSM drifts apart expecto patronus will be my legacy
Granted the dating app secured sex has only happened once since then lol
Ive been on dating apps just for sex and friends for like two years
an active discussion
i have a question i want to ask but i need to save it for when we're not having a discussion
expecto patronus
aporazeitgeist
yeah it happens in real life for me too so its the same but without "wait but we met on a dating app but youre not looking for a relationship?"
You can hit "get along" but not "date" or even "date" but not "date despite not wanting a relationship atm"
I think it's like activation energy
It happens in real life and dating apps for me
I don't say that lightly either
I think that was the most nonsensical thing I've ever said
I feel like we just experienced a zeitgeist, but not one that has anything to do with the meaning of the word
i think at least 3 times this year i went on date(s) with someone where we vibed with each other a lot but they didnt want a relationship even though we met on dating apps and that was v respectable



I'm right here
Yeah but right now i'm the only garbage
sometimes you have to be the bigger garbage
Well good cause she's making me feel like garbage
If I got texted "what did I do wrong" I would just feel like garbage
She straight up said idk how different a date should feel versus just hanging out with a friend
Well i'll never know
If she isn't responding then it's better to just not say anything
But i guess she was expecting more romantic stuff?
Cause I was trying to go into the date to develop a friendship
Its more about how ready or comfortable the other person is which you cant control
And we literally talked about how attraction is supposed to feel
Andy its rarely about what you did or didnt do
Like she's never been in a relationship before
sometimes red flags immediately make me think like oh no is he one of those guys with problematic opinions of women and things like that
Andy don't ask anything like that
What could i have done better?
OMG I MEANT THUMBS UP
Is being a murderer a demerit
Is that a weird text tho, like how would you phrase it
I think the red flags may be more amplified for women in general because you have to worry more about potential partners literally being murderers or rapists
I use a D. Merritt system personally
Idk calling it either a demerit system or a merit system seems clunky
theres definitely both red flags and green flags
do men not judge women on a demerit-based system
Was it a manga written by a woman or a man
so maybe you did do something wrong [2]
Although I read in a manga recently[1] that women judge men on a demerit-based system
I.e. who you meet
You can only control the people you meet to an extent
it could be a question of things you didn't do, or things you just aren't
As you have no control over how someone acts
And never base your success on others
See aspects that you should integrate and improve upon
I don't think it's necessarily about doing something wrong
Never phrase these things as what you did wrong, this is such a multidimensional topic
I'll get back to work but one thing
Like wheeeere did i go wrong
send her this entire chat
I made her like me so much in text that she gave me a shirt
Should i text hoiyee and ask what i did wrong lmao
Hence why people in relationships get hit on more
Dating and general attractiveness is soooooo momentum based
I'm currently at work but Andy I wouldn't doubt your ability to cuff a chick at all, I think it's just a process and once you find the things that do work for your person you'll find way more success
De raaailed that pot
Wooah
yaseen you should ask paul cause we're all following him
Grammar 4
If anyone wants to get uwu dinner with me tonight (i.e. they aren't going to hotpot and are shwiddit to eat halal with me) lmk
I accidentally made it a bit of a grammar 3 class
Barry and I def talked a bit  after hotpot and honestly it was really nice I wish I could get more one on one time with everyone
It's usually talking about shit like, "why do we yawn"
Oh awesome
i cant believe it
That's really good about the topic too
@Yaseen Big brain chat
why are incels relatable
hotpot or housla
same barry
Allen what time should we get there
Where am I?
Another thing btw, I watched the ContraPoints video on Incels recently
I have a friends show at 8 but Im joining after
I probably am
Is anyone going
Im gonna be late to hotpot at this rate
To the hotpot part? Probably too late for me to leave and make it but Housla ye
barry are you coming tonight
I mean it probably isn't a mind blow to normal people but he was like "Sex is just an experience." and I saw the face of god
I legit just try to be friends
Human Wu's Father added Yaseen Mohamed to the group.
I don't even hit on girls when i meet them
Yo if Yaseen hasnt had more sex than I have I will nut in my own mouth
the meaning of life
Yaseen told me shit that blew my mind
Barry!?
But i've been on the longest rejection streak
And I imagine its frustrating for girls to be hit on when maybe they just want a not awkward guy to talk about Pokmon with
Eh, for a long time I was really anxious and obsessive about the question of relationships and sex but it calmed down a lot after that night I went to hotpot with y'all.
Some people just arent compatible at the moment
But to step over into romance isnt just about you, its about your connection to the other person
Yeah but the girls i talk to don't even like that
Youre a funny and talented guy, I dont know who wouldnt want someone like that in their life
Maybe they love your company but you dont have romantic chemistry together
Deep
And i'm not trying to say i deserve anything right, but why do people keep telling me they love me if i can't get any love 
Again some of my best friends are folks Ive had crushes on
Andy lets just go to China and offer easy green card status
I think it helps to not see friendzoning as a failure
But i just get friendzoned i guess
I act charming, helpful, funny, whatever
Nothing will ever come to me, even after being in so many girl heavy situations
Yeah Thao might have some better perspective on this
not immediately like meet up now i mean like proposing it within the first 5 messages
Theyre usually pretty funny though
when a guy messages me to meet up immediately im like oh he just wants to fuck
And like, dont ask anyone out just be a cool dude and let things come to you
Anytime I do something that involves getting surrounded by women I only get funny stories out of it
Andy as chauvinistic as it sounds literally you could take a yoga class or something where youre surrounded by women and that vastly improves your odds
Holy shit dog
Same
Allen i legit would date you
hey
Boutta be gay
My charisma only gets me love from nsm
Usually I just ask to hang and then maybe after several weeks something MIGHT happen
But it still doesn't work
I dont think Ive ever asked anyone out on a date
UHall
I feel like i can do that pretty well
In my opinion these are the keys to succeed at dating: -Be the best, most interesting version of yourself -Be in an environment where you can meet a lot of people and show off your skills -Learn to read people and carefully flirt before making a move, and drop it immediately if theyre not interested
I was like wtf
Then i asked her out and she was like, ahh i've only known you for a month
I was eating with this girl i met in my class for like a whole month and we were pretty good friends
But because in the acting field Im surrounded by girls I can move on eventually
Some of my best friends are girls Ive had crushes on lol
Yeah it sucks but sometimes you gotta keep it at friendship
But it still felt so weird that I didn't want to try it again
So like, i feel like i can't do anything correctly lmao
But I tried it and I went on a date and the girl said she liked that I immediately got to the point
Then i try to be a bit more assertive and then it just pushes them away
I wanted to go the friendly approach and develop a friendship first, but then i don't seem interested enough
And I thought um wtf
But anyway one time I say a tip that said "ask to meet up within 5 messages"
Getting ghosted sucks and it happens to me a fair bit
Yeah I really dislike using them
Dating apps are ass
Most of the time when I get matches on dating apps it doesn't really go anywhere
I'd usually get ghosted or just straight up no's
If I can ask, how did the rejections usually go down?
Even if i "learned" everytime
Like how could i be rejected by all 7 girls i've tried to do romantic stuff with
My approach is treat everything like friends until they literally have their head on your shoulder
the dark side almost claimed you
*rejected
Like i'm so socially awkward i almost sympathized with inceldom for a second cause i didn't understand why i kept getting twisted
But you do build up a general pool of experience and an idea of what works
Approach wrong and chase wrong and you get punished and die
so you need to figure things out with each person
like everyone you play plays differently even if it's a MU you know
It's the bayo mu
Yeah it varies culturally which can be tough too
but it's kind of like in smash
alright let me say first of all I recognize this comparison is extremely unconducive to romantic success
You have to respect people differently
There are a LOT of routes
Everyone is different
Idk if it even is straightforward
Like what you should do is pretty straightforward, it just isn't easy
All the one nigh stands Ive had involved usually three-ish hours of talking at a bar or whatever beforehand
Well you've had wayyy more success
I think we're all in agreement here
If I made any of this sound like I think its easy its not lol
That person has an entire lifetime of experiences and beliefs
yeah so it goes back to erring on the side of safety so you get paralyzed
Yeah but reading is SO hard
but it can be hard
Its hard to give general advice other than to read the room
which is what Julian said I think
It really depends on the context
I think you can execute hesitation well
Being assertive with women is not in my skill set haha
I feel like in a situation where you think it'd be right to kiss a girl, if you even think you have to ask you probably shouldn't right?
Like if you walk up to someone and put your arm around them its weird but if they lean against you first its not
yeah so like its hard to know the context
Personally if I've been up talking for hours I can probably read the mood but first date stuff is way more awkward
Its all about execution, context, and toeing the line I think
So it's awkward and kinda weird when we do stuff that you think is just a normal move
What about Leon
Like you've had more sex than all of nsm combined julian lmao
Like if yall have been talking for hours and then you end up on your friends loft bed alone
Yeah of course you have to take context into consideration
but if some guy asked me if i wanted to kiss on the first date id be like what
it's just so fundamentally not okay lol
when I have to reach into my opposite pocket I feel so uncool it clings to me for about 3-4 hours
So i feel like you can do stuff like that
I love u too Ander
I take my dick out of my pocket there ya go
But like actually youre like a pretty sexy and socially aware person
Take something out of your pocket with your opposite hand
Theres a sexy way to do almost anything I think including asking if you can kiss someone
I believe u dude
I wasn't actually being sarcastic lol
a cool dude
A cool smoocher
Wait that sounded sarcastic
Well you're really cool
The first person I kissed thought it was hot lol
That hasnt been my experience at all
It kills the mood
I dont think anyone would resent you for checking in unless you were being prodding about it
But anyway going back to fear of crossing boundaries for a second, the best way to check that if youre worried is to literally ask the other person IE can I kiss you instead of just going for it
or supposedly anyway

I found out recently that this is fake

cause we're all cool dudes
Now it just dude
When I dress well my mom says honey you look like a DUDE because back in her day dude meant cool dude
because it fundamentally equates characters / moves that are simply good with being dumb
i feel like im not afraid of saying things cause of a witch hunt cause i feel like people calling you out on stuff is totally appropriate but im afraid of saying stuff cause its like im actually saying things i dont know lmao
Our language has evolved a lot in ways we dont realize I think
That this concept would become mainstream
Not even safe
It makes me so angry
No word is safe
fuck
Social media accelerates change in language I think
like
for things that don't make sense in any way
everyone keeps saying it now
The Smash community has ruined glue eating tbh
Even reputable ones like BBC and Al Jazeera
Most of the comment sections on mainstream news sites have the top comments on some variation of oh not another witch hunt stop being so sensitive
Its people who follow him, people who follow Hannity, people who follow Ben Shapiro, etc. Its not just one person, it spreads
Where the dictionary definition of literal includes not literal things
I suppose eventually it could become like what happened to literal
But the thing is its not just Trump
I see how that has the effect of eroding the meaning of the phrase, but I also think that's similar to saying that the word innocent would change meaning if Trump used it
Theyre not just lying about it on a personal level, theyre invalidating a larger cultural issue which is proven to be happening
Nah whats happening to them is not witch hunts even if they call them that
Yes, but also in regards to denying a greater societal problem
Just not honestly
The perpetrators are using it to claim that they are innocent, right?
I think its safe to say people in this chat are safe from those criticisms they fear and it generally doesnt apply to yall
So the term that once meant innocent but decided guilty and mobbed now just means criticized
Now you have our president or sexual assault perpetrators saying witch hunt in regards to things that have happened
However
Historically, witch hunts were oppressed people (women in colonial times) literally being mobbed and killed for things that didnt happen  There are situations where the term can be used accurately. IE during the Satanic Panic of the 80s when people thought DnD was a gateway to Satanism when nothing was actually happening
Just not too much
I feel like the term witch hunt is a deflection of legitimate criticism nowadays by those in power, but they made people who arent in power think it applies to them as well
I think it's best to have the fear to a small extent to keep you in check
I think if you have that fear youre already a better person than the people actually being criticized of this stuff
that said I'm still paralyzed
Sometimes you can be wrong and you stop and apologize, but you can't let that fear paralyze you from acting at all
I feel like it's better to take a bit more initiative as long as you don't do anything dumb
1. Yeah I get what you mean about gender being tied to wrong things as we tie it to the sexist idea of both men and women 2. With the meaning and life and botw, narrowing the question would give so many possibilities of better answers i.e.  where are you going now. 3. Witch hunts shouldnt exist.
Ive never related so fucking much tho
but when I step back and think about it
Personally I always felt so afraid of showing interest or making any type of "move" without being 100% sure that I'm not making someone uncomfortable
Cause i think i understand but want to clarify
How so?
I think it's kind of similar to dating / flirting
Precisely. Personally, i find that dynamic of being scared to even ask questions regarding minorities is counterproductive to fixing issyes, but other people def feel otherwise
Ight ima list based on all the things lol
I think it's important to be conscious of potentially offending people when you talk about things but that's also a concept that you can take too far
thats funny cause already the idea of being scared to breach a topic or face a witch hunt is already something where if you say that sometimes youd get a witch hunt coming after you
just comment on botw
I want to comment on both these things but I feel like Im ignoring one if I comment on the other
Yeah, especially with a lot of issues stemming from the confusion of the two (gender and sexuallity) but i still find it.... interesting, to think that people arguing to not conflate the two can be scared of breaching the topic, else become the subject of a witch hunt
I wanted this chat to be for discussing stuff that's interesting / complicated
Life is like a war against impermanence
It boils down to surviving and procreating but that doesnt have to mean thats all that matters or all there is
You could look at life the same way
But it isnt the vast majority of the game
Thats the point
idk if this makes sense but i think so much of gender is tied to like wrong things about gender kind of and that sort of makes it right? like how gender and sexuality are conflated a lot so performing gayness is a sexuality but comes in the form of performing femininity sometimes
Like the goal of botw is to beat ganon
I kind of think its okay for the point of life to just be that though
Isnt this the chat to accidentally say problematic things so we can discuss why its problematic
I guess thats a different discussion,  of should a topic be feared even by those who support the cause?
You could say the purpose of life is to perpetuate life but that doesnt sound satisfactory especially to people who look for more spiritual answers
yea i feel like its hard and especially with gender cause i dont want me or anyone to accidentally say something problematic
Its such a broad topic
At the same time though its kind of a technicality
Like what could they mean
But the meaning of life is like asking the meaning of dogs
I always felt that if you wanna say what is the purpose of life or the most important thing thats something you can easily talk about
I feel like i have a more concrete understanding of "the meaning of life" than i do relative to gender, hence I'm trying to gather more data on others views
No other thing means anything
If someone is identifying as a type of gender, than by definition of identity it is a subset. If someone is not identifying themselves as gender, then them labeling themselves as gender non-conforming is another identification and another subset of identity
i want to make a "x is when you y and the more you y the x-ier it is" joke with gender but I can't think of a 'y' for gender so that means it's complicated
Although I hate the idea of the meaning of life
if someone asked me the meaning of life id be like uhhh yea and thats what id say to my idea of gender so i guess what would everyone else say?
whats your idea of gender
Yeah but it isnt wrong to discuss what someones idea of the meaning of life is
if people were discussing the meaning of life i think thatd be cool and id listen and say nothing
i just dont know what id really say to that discussion but like its not a bad discussion to have i guess is what i mean
I think you can discuss the meaning of life though especially if you both are aware that youre discussing an inherently subjective issue
it makes sense to define it and stuff too
at least thats how i treat it or think of it
its like if someone asked you the meaning of life or something and they could say anything and youd be like ok and debating it like theres a truth you want to move towards is maybe not right
what i think is that someone could say its a subset of identity and someone else could say its not and either way id have no input of my own or i wouldnt respond with my own views or something, id just be like ok
i agree tho like thats my stance on what i think or debating things about gender like to me i think everyone defines it for themselves and im super ok with that and discussing it or debating it like a kind of truth or something isnt something that i think is good or right?
Nah you good
Am I misunderstanding?
If gender is a subset of identity? My answer is that I don't really care
Wait thats not what he asked though lol
I'm on team let people do what they want, I won't ask if it's not my business. And I leave it there unless they feel like explaining further
I just wanna know what you guys think
yea idk cause some people would say yes but some people would say its partially performative too so idk
Because things vary on individual as well as cultural levels
I think the answer to everything you're asking is "it can be"
Is gender a subset of identity
(ignore the title of the video it's much more to do with gender expression than Feminism but this was at the height of Feminist titles for YouTube algorithms)
like if youre an artist and you express that i guess
Is there a distinction between gender and identity in the sense that someone could express it, and you could say thats not really related to gender
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqtNSdDFGBM
its like talking about politics without relating it to the left or the right i guess
Some people want to lose the gendered feeling is the thing. In the words of comedian Eddie Izzard, "They're not women's clothes. They're my clothes"
Or to put it another way
Its hard to define without relating to masculinity or femininity, because if you step far enough back that you just talk about identity, I think you lose the gendered feeling
There's a PBS Idea Channel video from a few years back that tackled it hang on
Gender at its core is expression
the abcs of lgbt is so good and has so many things and definitions from people who identify as that thing but i dont think it had aporagender
What is gender at its core
Although
The wiki phrasing is vague
I think I get it better now
Like I wouldn't want to get someone to explain things in terms I can understand unless they want to but I also don't want to just stop at "yeah sure"
In that case it's probably best to talk to someone who identifies as aporagender so they can explain it
You don't really need to understand anything but I think if you can understand someone's sense of identity that's preferable
yea julian i feel the same
i guess its not something i try to understand cause i feel like gender is like anything is ok so dont question it and as a result theres not much to debate for me???
I don't really feel a need to conceptualize it but I've never been a mathematical thinker Like as long as I know your pronouns we good
like someone could tell me that gender is (`[  ]) and id be like ok
oh yeah i dont understand at all and i accept that as my understanding
Especially to a degree in which i can explain
I guess what i struggle with is that i in theory understand that gender is by nature nonbinary and more personal, but its hard to conceptualize mentally.
A 6D spectrum is a solid way to look at it I think as long as it's not a straight line
India also had a ton of different gender identities prior to colonization that fell outside the realm of a simple A to B spectrum but that culturally went away after it was colonized
infinityD
Especially in regards to gender. Going for the most well known, the Native Americans had the concept of people who were "Two Spirit"
yea
Well  yeah, isnt there less a spectrum in 2D but more like a spectrum of like 6D where you can be anywhere
This isn't the only way to think about things
This extends to things like politics as well, where many imagine a political spectrum inbetween democrat and republican
Different cultures view things like gender differently. In the US, we're used to seeing things in binary
http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Aporagender
This is what I'm reading
No i like seriously just went from being moderately confused to just not understanding anything
what is a gendered feeling
exactly
Wait what
sometimes you eat a food and its like BAM but also what and thats gender
I think it becomes easier to understand when you don't mentally view gender as a spectrum with masculine and feminine on opposite ends
Aporagender is pretty much everything that isnt male, female, agender, or between male and female.
I don't know if I understand what gender is anymore
im a gender fiend and ive never heard of that
is anyone familiar with the word aporagender
It's actually crazy how much wasted potential there is
theyre so good
kinetic batteries shouldve caught on
Science will have fully merged with magic
I feel like if yawning ever gets solved science might be complete
Can't waste all that shit
You should carry around a kinetic battery wherever you go
Imagine if you could harvest energy from the yawn impulse
Which explains pre-show if your vocal chords are preemptively tightening, your body instinctively needs more air
It's also just a way to take in more oxygen
Its so powerful you could be like a fictional character not even in a visual medium and make real people yawn
Before shows i would yawn a bunch back stage lol
I yawn a lot when i'm nervous
Made me yawn
Hence why you don't yawn when you have adrenaline
Even THINKING ABOUT it
The contagion is so that it spreads around to everyone like a message saying "there's no danger we can rest"
The prevailing theory is that it's a signal to other members of your tribe that it's safe to go to sleep
The level of contagion honestly feels like a glitch
Has anyone ever explained yawning
I wonder if thered be less misunderstandings if he could talk
Hes a good fella ultimately even though hes selfish
I think Subspace Emissary is still indicative of how Sakurai feels about Dedede
fair
One of them isnt in the Kirby universe
Thats two games lol
Dedede's a dick and does bad things but he's never outright evil except for the time Dark Matter possessed him. In Nightmare in Dreamland he's trying to protect the Star Rod and in Subspace Emissary his brooches save the gang
*appearnces
But his main appearance has been as a helper
Like technically he is
Is bandana dee a villain I actually cant tell
DDD has villain moments ya know
They are midtier yes
Yeah varia is just lava resistant it would be a pretty mid tier suit for the antagonist to nab
Oh fuck it was phazon right
Also Paul, Dark Samus is from Metroid Prime 2 & 3. Metroid Prime ate Samus's Phazon Suit at the end of Metroid Prime 1 and fused with it to become Dark Samus
First of all Dedede isn't a villain. He's literally perfect. Two, me and Bowser are married, neither of us wear the pants; we're a team.
Its either bowser or k rool free
ganon super destroyed the botw world so easily
But i think bokoblins and shit are just natives
The infected guardian robots are
I think theyre at least related to him
They seem pretty freelance
Nah ganon def doesn't control most of those minions
In botw you can respawn with blood moons but I dont know if thats a good thing
Kremling I think
He leads a bunch of crocodile men
i didn't even know k rool had minions
Also the mario world seems the least life threatening since you can opt for racing or party games
Ganon enlisted me long ago
And by shit i mean stuff
Bowser gives his minions the most shit

It depends on what happens to the captured things consciousness
Um I think both
Or does the tank feel pain
When you cappyture a tank in odyssey and get hit do you feel pain
Wacky cartoon robots are still robots
Okay but clown car feels pain

Anyway megaman is the highest tech
Im just saying its not like a quantifiable thing since its a philosophical concept
So to some level they recognize I am a cat. Cats have needs
Cats act so weird towards humans because they think were big dumb cats so they bring us dead birds to feed us because they think we need it
Even if were defining it as self awareness though animals like cats have it and dogs and dolphins are more intelligent than them
A bunch of people have different definitions for it
Sentience is a pretty arbitrary term anyway
Isnt beating like primarily physical pain though
what if aliens are on such a high plane of intelligence that we don't meet their criteria for sentience
Which sounds like what Andy is talking about
I think we shouldnt conflate sentience and like, civilization
Before that people would beat their dogs and shit on a much more widespread level
This was the experiment that revolutionized animal rights because we realized animals feel emotional pain and seek emotional comfort
Instead of hey look it's the Chinese people from earth

Look it's the Galran people from planet Galra
how would we know if they're sentient
or what if we went to other planets and saw aliens
And not just instinct driven
Like, most scifi stuff really oversimplifies alien planets to one race of people lol
Do yall remember the Harry Harlow monkey experiment from psych classes? The whole point of that was to prove that animals are sentient
i think they would
Like aliens wouldn't come to earth and think the dogs are sentient
I think in terms of scifi stuff
A lot of animals are definitely self aware
People tie it to self-awareness
Its like, can have thoughts right
I dont think thats what sentient means?
And clown car
Humans are the only known sentient beings
I think all sentient beings have pain as a defense mechanism like fear
Does any organism not avoid lava
Pain would have to be something that changes decision
They just cant scream
They have nerves so yeah
Do bugs or fish feel pain
You have hair all over yo body
@Chris Colon define pain
He has tech
Lucario can speak
Not bald ones though
Racists either feel the most or the least pain
If you can be racist you can feel pain
Does game&watch feel pain
Like if you program a robot to recoil from X input and want to avoid it, is that pain
Can wreck it Ralph feel pain
If a robot has hair i think it can feel pain
marth had ballista and lucina doesnt
Theres like the dark ages
Well being ahead in time doesnt just mean better technology
But they have the same technology lol
Lucina is from wayyyyy ahead of marth's time
What does it take for a robot to feel pain
SJ also says meta Ridley
Shulk is from the future
I trust
SJ says shulk

I love that megaman just has a little crt in him
It shoots a canon and a toy
Clown car might beat blue falcon

Bowser Jr is lower tech than falcon

Like bowser jr just gets car back
But in a canonically scientific manner
Almost everyone can generate things from nothing
So can thatch
And generate things from nothing
So can thatch
Megaman can teleport
Megaman and the clown car cant come to that conclusion
Lol if you have hair you must feel pain
And wanted to commit suicide in the bomb factory
Megaman has hair
Rob actually feels remorse
I feel like that's hard to say
Megaman expresses pain but doesnt feel it
ROB only feels pain
Or rob
Dtilt alone is pretty high tech
Does megaman feel pain
It expresses pain but doesnt feel it
Isnt that what pain ultimately is
The clown car cant feel pain it just has a output when it takes damage
He has more tech but its more feasible than a jet pack
The clown car is extreeemely high tech
I would put Bowser Jr below Diddy
Like the main argument is that clown car can feel pain
Also ROB
Im not sure bowser jr is top tier
Miigunner
So megaman, bowser jr, the spacies, and samus
Are launch stars tech
Yes
he has a spacesuit
is olimar high tech
*materia
like k rool has a laser
I dont think he has material
wow the dk series actually is decent tech
Advent Children Cloud has a higher tech sword
Does he have materia
his sword has high tech ff7 energy
is cloud high tech
And collar
holy shit bowser brancelets!!!!
I think Lucario is below him now
I completely forgot about Bowser bracelets

Bowser has gauntlets
No eggs are from himself
Yoshi has shoes
Yo wait is Yoshi as low as Bowser or do eggs count
Final Smash tho
He just explodes
Diddys is functional transportation it doesnt just explode
Neither has Diddy
Yeah but we havent figured out how to do that safely
So pokemon trainer is higher than pokemon
Diddy's tech revolves around sticking explosives inside of wooden tubes lol
Like they might be beyond illusion
Pokeballs seem really high tech
Diddys functioning jet pack is higher tech than what we have in modern times
no move will have as good a name as dr mario usmash
How high tech are pokeballs
Names dont count
wait dr mario bair is called "drop kick, MD"
the official name of dr mario fsmash is defibrillator
Lets go
Wait Dr Tornado has super armor now?
Diddy kong is a lot of low tech stuff
Does dr Mario definitely have a defibrillator though
So idk
They seem like equal time frame
i feel like a defibrillator is higher than a motorcycle and the stethoscope on his head is higher than goggles
I think wario could be above dr Mario
yea luigi went way up
And goggles
Wario has a motor cycle
Wario bike is above everything luigi has had until this game
He has a bike
Woah what
he needs dr e gadd
And as we know the color purple was invented within the last 100 years
wario the lowest tech mario bro by far
Mario also has purple coins
Not in smash but
its dr marios biology
Fludd can let you jetpack
actually fludd is higher tech
Nah I think he just makes the electricity
Like what is the source of the shock
yea
Mario has a construction skin
What is fsmash like a defibrillator?
like fsmash
but dr
Fludd
Is mario above dr Mario
hes just wherever a gun is
Is duck hunt high tech
is illusion the highest tech move in the game
Its no illusion
Joker is literally a modern day high school student
zair is pretty high tech i guess
Wow my brain hurts gonna step away from this for a sec
it feels electric for some reason
Her only electric move is charge shot I think? Maybe zair? Dark Samus has more electric effects but it might be the biology
I dont think its ever been electric in smash
In Zero Mission it kinda did
I dont think so
doesnt it have electric effect though
Yeah I dont think Samus up B is electric I think it just hits a lot?
I would put Fox over ZSS in terms of up B because rocket propelled shoes are cool but making fire not burn and then shoot you forward is amazing
Is Samus up b electric
but samus up b > zss up b = fox up b
Like on the tier list
Zss is separate from Samus though
does mk have tech
yea cause fox up b is zss up b but big
Is it though
samus up b is more tech than fox up b cause its electric
their up b is like the same tech as zss side b but the fire is bigger and their whole body
what if its a part of their biology
Up b is tech
Star fox doesnt have magic though so everything is presumably tech
what even is it
do they use tech to do side b
Side b is more high tech than whatever Samus does
down b actually breaks physics
And metal legs
like how high tech is down b
They have reflectors
star fox doesnt even have suits
samus's suits are so high tech
does falcon go to space
They could be above her
theyre high but below samus
Wait I forgot all of star fox lol
Less
are inklings more or less tech than snake
A car is pretty up there in tech
Thats tech
Using demons
falcon a high tech character
Her guns were crafted though
fe tier
Its more that theyre more magic than tech
i cant believe theyre not real
Glasses put her above Bowser
wait she has glasses
she could be in no clothes tier
Are her clothes hair
She just shoots magic I think
She doesnt have bullets
wait are they actually not real guns
But theyre like not real
and rocket shoes
but she has guns
Bayo might be low tier
except probably less
its the same tech as like fe magic
How tech is holy water that actually works on everyone
excuse me its the poltergust 3000
I think thats just an extension of the alien biology
Kirby has a surprising amount of tech
Dark Samus has more dark samuses
The latter
Is luigis poltergust considered a vacuum or a more futuristic ghost sucking thing
Game changer
Thats tech
Wait Ryu has a sandbag in his win pose
Kens clothes are newer but Ryus are better taken care of
I think taunts might change a lot
Ight who has the higher quality clothes
In the Street Fighter universe people can shoot things by kicking or punching hard enough
No but Pac-Man has heihachi
also doesnt heihachi own a high tech company or something
I dont think its technological
no its fire
heihachi has electric
But is the fire Ki?
Ryu shokonatsu is fire so they both have equal capability
Is Heihachi tech
I dont think ki is tech
actually hadoken is probably higher tech than fire
ken has fire
Does namco roulette buff Pac-Man
Ken probably owns more tech but its not present in game
i just know ryu is known for having no shoes
No
does ken have shoes
Its the same gi isnt it
Is Ryu or Ken higher
Oh yeah lol
high tech for pacman
or like modern tech
hydrants are high tech
I think the fruit is just GMOs
The galaxian is
Hard engineered fitness wear
Are Pac Man fruit modern tech
She is above all FE though right?
Like Ponytas mane
WFT might be the most mid tier
If its not a belt its just naturally occurring fire
does he wear a belt or is that like his skin
oh yeah he uses ropes
Also he uses ropes and wears a belt
Language isnt tech
Does Incineroar come out of a ball
Like you couldnt really mistake him for a human
is bowser higher than incineroar cause bowser has language
I know X is but mega man might still be a robot
Androids are robots constructed to resemble humans
Its debatable
Actually is mega man at the point of being an Android
Battle network is the non physical alternate timeline
Ok i wasnt sure
Nuts n bolts
Yeah theres no human in him
Hes a robot
Cmon Paul
i only played battle network so idk
Sentient robot that can copy skills just by fighting against them
Android
is he even physical
Is megaman a cyborg or an android
He might be
Wait so is megaman #1
Ridleys tech changes depending on costume
It just is a suit that resembles mechanical but is skin
I had no idea what Dark Samus was or is
Like copied its design
I dont think thats tech
Dark Samus is an organism that latched onto the Varia suit I think
just alien biology
Dark Samus is a biological being that mimics shapes
shes like biological tho
Game and watch is modern
The AI is a good point but what about Dark Samus
What the fuck is Game and Watch
holy fuck megaman
MEGAMAN
Dreidels are pretty old school
Sentient self aware robot > armor with weapons
hes like literally all tech but the tech isnt high
rob isnt even high tech tho
Nah rob is prehistoric
Yeah ROB
What a time to be alive
ROB
Is anyone above Samus
mii gunner is definitely below samus
Wait wtf is Palutena shes all magic
also palutenas b move is like extremely high tech
Well he had the sword before I guess
Miigunner is probably #1
all his b moves are tech
At least he went up a tier from smash 4
I mean he has swords I think that puts him in FE tier
is pit high tech
ganon is like between fe tier and prehistoric
It better be
Allen is this all for a dumb tierlistmaker pic on twitter
Or archaic
FE characters are there own tier
in between modern and prehistoric is like medieval
There should be something between modern and prehistoric for swords
Then having no tech or clothes tier
And ties
They dont have anything but at least wear clothes
He immersed himself in nature
Prehistoric
he went down in tech
Modern
yea not anymore
And a tie
Or he used to
Futuristic
DK has bongos
I think the tiers are like
Waiting
Wait
Nice
Its only in smash or else everyone would have tech
It was
Was shotput in the original olympics in some form
not in smash but like canonically
Wait does she?
And Im fairly sure Mewtwo doesnt come out of a Pokeball right?
puff has a microphone to sing with
I never played cenoblade but ima assume it is tech
When was shot put invented
So Lucario and Bowser are way down
I dont think lucario does
Presumably
is shulks sword technology
Since he naturally produces it
Probably not for bowser
Its tier 0
Does Lucario come out of a Pokeball
Wait is fire technology
Poke balls should count
Yeah thats why bowser is bottom tier
Clothes are technological advancements
Clothes count
Rope snake is not tech
No Pokeball, no clothes, just natural gifts and training
Robins books are tech but old tech
Yeah bowser is down there
Bowser might be least tech
like its magic but also researched and developed
is robins magic tech
Idk Duster just has it
was his rope snake invented or like born that way
clown car is super tech
Is rope snake tech
I think
I dont know how much of a technological advancement is clown car
Magic isnt
What about magic tech like PSI
Bows are tech
Yes
Yes
Are we counting bows
How are we defining technology
I dont think bowsers shell is technology
Isnt bowsers shell him?
bowsers shell isnt a technological advancement tho
Like swords or Bowsers shell
his final smash is tech
Are we counting tech as any sort of tool
He wears his tablet
Wait link only has techy bombs
I think hes on the same level as puff
Do we count Mewtwo as tech
*the tie*
Is that worth more or less than wearing a tie
I was just thinking about that
Puff comes from a poke ball though right
Like little Mac
Rip puff
He has no tech but his tie could put him over some chars
The tie
DK is probably bottom tier
But maybe around the top 10 are top tier
Well its all relative
Whats the cutoff
I assume the Samuses are above him
Is link top tier in the technological tier list
Link made it to 2008
and then it hits you away from the stage instead of towards
link bomb recovery tho it feels so good
Wait i guess just tink and yink now
Cancelling tether is important for bm and going under smashville as a samus or link
Yeah thats what im saying
oh u mean like bair down bair to get around the bair snapping to ledge
Its a good os bc we want to die
Yeah i think you could die or it could work
Like you either tether cancel bair or just input bair
how would you not just fastfall bair and die
wait i dont get that os
And then die bc you fastfall baired haha idiot
So you can os mash bair down bair
You can hit down to instantly cancel a tether tho
Beefy tether
i dont think it works with tethers
Im not sure
If i tether right below stage i just upair
Does holding down work for tethers
Do*
Feels hard to determine what my whip will fo
I dont like when i try to run off bair with a belmont and grab ledge
It might as well already
Make whip hit fullscreen ez
like the main thing is that belmonts have such small horizontal speed
Like you cant hold your limit for it forever
maybe ganon yea
I think cloud recovery is pretty bad
Ganon
theres only like doc and mac
Mine
like whos recovery is worse than the belmonts
Castlevania judgement
Maybe its based on that one 3d fighter
Idk how you gauge weight but they can take hits so ?
belmonts being sluggish and falling fast offstage :(
Yeah
Have you played a castlevania allen
They probably did it bc simon is sluggish and falls fast in the games
I wish snake would get a weight buff lol
like idk if ive ever been in a 150%+ situation
actually i feel like pika kills easier than all my other characters which is pretty dumb
i think pika uthrow kills at like 200% still
Why is Simon a top 10 heavy
I'm gonna test kill%s on my flight
sometimes richter throw just kills and im like ok
i dont even know what throws kill
Neither did Nick evidently
I have no idea when any throws kill in this game
I may have had rage but i cant remember
Simon is a a top 10 heavy and top 10 fastfaller
I killed fakhris simon at like 150 and didnt think much of it
Wait damus upthrow might be really strong
sometimes it just works and kills you at 0 and sometimes it doesnt work
idk how to even get out of wolf dthrow side b
Ive seen whatever that thing is when people wall bounce and accelerate
Same tbh
I havent seen any rage base kb kills in this game
nice
wait wolf dthrow side b
I found Nikita
I need to find out if i can cheese with rage upb in this game
ive gotten reverse cheesed like hey surprise pika up b is punishable on hit
i have yet to do or find any cheese
Lol yeah
samus dash attack killing???
Samus projectiles are truly some alien technology in this game
what?????? samus kill throws???
what??????????
Same with bthrow
Killing with damus upthrow looks even stupider if you can believe it
Corrin 
depth first search???
Dragon fang shot
wait whats dfs
Yeah its like dfs to pin lol
Its like dfs
And dash attack is stronk
And low kb
Charge shot has a lot of hit stun
Its not a full charge shot
i cant even conceptualize it in my head
wth is charge shot to dash attack
Idk if its even real
Don't get hit by charge shot to dash attack btw
Its important to play to your outs I think
Mostly because comebacks were like always possible with rage
I thought about it a lot in smash 4
But so far in ult I dont know my lose conditions so 
It doesnt help much with neutral but it helps when youre ahead or behind
Especially when it comes down to not throwing, or cheesing out a comeback
I didnt until I played hs but it helps me a lot
Do you guys think about win conditions / lose conditions in smash
Like I would have hated to find out in tournament that I could die to damus charge shot to dash attack, and for every thing like that I learn theres a lot more that I havent
Its hard though
It could be an issue of adjusting my mentality
Like my approach to the game starts with knowing characters and not getting cheesed but thats less of a factor if you can push forward with your own game plan
But what Falln says is also somewhat of a counterpoint
This is kind of what I was saying
https://twitter.com/fallnaway/status/1073253275003056128?s=21
Two axes beat swords
Thatch is 7 of them
Damn Im glad this game only has 10 good characters lol
Should I put the ganon tweet in the PT notes
Right now its apparently a Pokdex but thats just a coincidence
For the average person yeah its gonna be difficult, i just think it leads us to a new age of how to go about smash in particular
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f-bdmc1MzEIxleb3Y8NjVfKgR2fgqlqE
Same I made a folder
I started writing matchup notes cuz I can already tell how hard it's gonna be to remember some shit
But on average theres a lot more just winging it and executing your general game plan
For people who try hard, its still possible to remember and execute character specific stuff
Especially with the advent of discords and shareable notes
Fair. I agree in concept with you. I just dont know if i agree completely in practicality
There just isnt as much time for learning MU intricacies when your playtime is divided between comparatively more MUs
Kill %s is just one thing though
Idk. For tip tiers that seens reasonable. Not even trying i had emp touch memorized for like 6 characters. I feel putting in time to learn kill move percents on 10 characters isnt bad. But moving into ultimate that seems different
Obviously you cant do that now with rage but even without rage I doubt I could remember
Like in Brawl it was common to know exact kill %s for your kill moves on top tiers
In general, i feel that in smash4 only really mattered at higher level bar a few speciaal instanced
Its kind of a trade off between deep MUs vs diverse MUs
Its not necessarily a bad thing to have more viable characters but being able to initially learn and also remember MU-specific things just becomes much harder especially for mid level players
In smash 4 you could learn everything there is to know about the WFT mu and it would be hard to retain long term
One of the nice things about melee is that the number of MUs competitive players need to know is small enough that they can reasonably be remembered
I feel like the issue is more weird interactions rather than diversity
Even in smash 4 the roster was big enough that arbitrary MU inexperience was probably a bigger factor in competitive results than it should have ideally
Do you mean matchup wise?
People usually say the more viable characters, the better but I feel like past a certain point character diversity hinders competitive play
       ,            
oh god... oh god. no...
He grabbed at the dirt and stones around him
It sounded faint and different than the ones that usually plagued his fragile mind
He could hear a shanty coming from his head, or was it someone singing in the distance
But is thatch alive
He followed the sun as it set on the dismal scenery around him
His clothes stuck to him soaked in who knows whos blood
His bones aching, feeling like grinding gears
Oh god oh man
The disheveled pirate muttered as he dragged himself along the path
Oh man oh god
Oh dear god... no...
Oh no
Yes but every day is an episode
You ever wonder if you whole life is leading up to a candid freeze frame in the credits
God only knows
?
Then would that justify them being ablento take it from your cart cause you're an asshole
Tough to say. If you had nothing better to do and were really petty and the star aligned just right, you could take the last copy of an item someone you hated wanted and put it in your shopping cart in front of their faces until they left the store, then put it back.
But for how long do you have a reasonable ethical claim to things in your cart
Yeah
I ask because if you took something out of someones shopping card that would be seen universally as a dick move right
Run away
What are the boundaries
If you touch something in a supermarket or store, do you get temporary / conditional ownership of it
Like bottom 5 the better variance would be better since you cant get lower
Depends how low
Like if you compare smash 4 ganon to falco, falco probably has a better MU vs most characters but arguably a lower chance of winning
If two characters are both bad, would the worse one with higher variance be better
Id have opened with east tbh
My grandparents just werent weeb enough
I guess one of them needed to meet east
Theres no east though
Like my dad has south, my uncle has north and my aunt has west
But his name also reads as emerging from hardship
Its kind of cool because he and his siblings all have a cardinal direction in their names
His name is a homophone or emerging from hardship
Its called the three bitter years / three years of hardship in Chinese
My dad is the oldest in his family and he was born right after the Great Famine
I guess all my parents / aunts / uncles grew up around that time
Some of my relatives were telling me about growing up during the cultural revolution and the time before
It was an awful time for him

And those that werent were just not investing anymore
i feel like still sometimes people say "the market is bad" when it comes to jobs and stuff so it feels like the great recession is life sometimes
A lot of sad Julian stories today but my Grandma died because of her hoarding habits from growing up in the Great Depression. She never threw away expired foods and developed a rare organ cancer from eating expired goods for her whole life because she had to hoard them as a kid
I thought it sounded scary and bad but distant until my mom told me how it affects my dad (stock broker). People were bringing guns into financial advising offices and terrorizing banks.
Because if they were born old enough to remember it it was probably their whole childhood
I think they just thought it was life
Did 30s kids think damn that was really the Great Depression
Like we werent super young but all I knew at the time was that the economy was getting worse, but now in retrospect its called the Great Recession
There's another one coming strap in folks
Its kind of crazy that we experienced the Great Recession
But it never clicked in my mind as unemployment
And I obviously remember 9/11
Like I remember us suddenly not needing a babysitter because he was always home
I can't believe that never clicked in my head
Our financial situation is as bad as it is because my dad narrowly missed dying in 9/11 and was traumatized for a year and didn't work and the Great Recession happened right after

I'm very recently finding out a lot of family secrets I'm surprised I didn't know earlier
And like it feels like something I should know, but also its been 20 years and idk how to bring it up again lol
I still dont know why they divorced


imagine calling a girl
Apparently my dad got my moms number and called her and said he was just checking to see if it worked
I think my parents met on some kind of business trip or something
He forgot the ring in his car when he proposed to her
Lets go employment
They were coworkers when my dad actually had to get a job
Julian how did your parents meet
And because he lived rent free with his family even after coming here and never worked a real job he became very bad with money
My dad was rich by Filipino standards then he came here and wasn't anymore
Rip
She still has expensive tastes though
My mom was actually pretty rich as a young adult but she said she retired in her 20s to do whatever she wanted allegedly
But in some ways it would have been nice
And the conclusion I reached was definitely not lol
Recently I thought about how different my life would be if I just grew up in China and whether I would be happier
I'm probably a weird case because my Asian parent was an artist and neither of them finished school
And acting school is a scam literally nothing is worth $170000 of constantly increasing debt
Economic anxiety stuff has been hitting me super hard lately tbh because I can't afford Smash or a Switch
To an extent
Well for Asian immigrants our parents already broke us free
O tru
or like not at our young ages rn i mean
Why not
none of us are breaking out of our economic castes tho :(
And not one you get solely by putting in hard work
To break out of your economic caste is a huge achievement
My friend on Jessica Jones worked hella hard in acting school but also her dads a big producer
I feel like nobody should be hard on themselves for not being hugely successful at a young age because one of the biggest factors is the situation theyre born into
Time is scary 
The only aspect of that that bothers me is I wish I could have done more earlier because I want my grandparents to be able to see that Im doing things
At least thats how I try to rationalize not becoming super successful at a young age
I kind of feel like you dont need to rush in life as long as youre moving toward what you wanna do and where you want to end up
Oof
My relatives said it was because he wasnt sure when / if he would see me again and that was just like
In the last few days of my my grandpa seemed like he was in a bad mood
People say it all the time but most people only understand that after something awful has happened to that person
I know people say that all the time but I guess this was my way of processing that
Like in fact you never know if youll see anyone again so its important to cherish the time you do have
But that made me think its not right to think that only about people who are old
At first I thought I should make sure my time with him counts because I never know if I might not see him again
I mean its not as if I actually thought he just wasnt getting older but still Im not really sure what to do with this information
He used to be independent but now my aunts and uncles are always worried about him
He always has to nap in the afternoon and you can tell when hes confused / forgetful about something
But this time when I saw him I realized he really has gotten older
Like he was already old to begin with but he didnt really seem like he was aging especially compared to the fact that I went from being a baby to an adult in the same amount of time
But I think because his health is good he always seemed like a static level of old to me
My grandpa has been old since I was born since like hes my grandpa
But now I see my parents and other relatives infrequently enough that sometimes theyre noticeably older than last time
Because its so gradual
Its so hard to notice people aging when you see them regularly
Relevant vine https://youtu.be/O6BlVRdE6BU
You already did
Or sometime I suppose
I want to write a novel about time someday
Thats the deepest thing Ive ever heard
We had to read that in 9th grade and my teacher had just been told she wasn't gonna be rehired next year so it was the first time she gave me a passing grade on a paper
Im fine with time because more of it passing generally means Ill get more financially stable
The best I can do is think about the river in Siddhartha and imagine that I understand
Its too hard of a concept to think about
And when I feel at peace with it I still cant tell if Im experiencing calm or more of a lapse in understanding
It only makes me feel angry and afraid
I worker 3 days this week and probably accomplished 1 day's worth of work at besy
Fuck time tbh
I think thats interesting too since things like weeks and hours loop, and you can compare that to how we perceive age and years
Friday wouldnt be Friday without a routine
I feel like this is less perception of time and more just perception of schedule
These are the important questions
To what extent can you even apply reason to the perception of time though
But if thats the case, is that something you can balance out with a perception like MMWFF or again does further deviation from reality only contribute to the week feeling long or otherwise wrong
So if the actual week is MTWTF, and your perception is MTWFF, then ordinarily people would say that week feels long
As in Monday feels like Monday, etc, setting aside the question of what it really means for a day to feel like itself
Lets say that a week feels normal if each day feels like the day it actually is
But I think that on average you would simply think its Friday
I guess it depends on how you frame the assumption in your head because you could think its already Friday or it must be Friday by now
Or does simply being wrong extend how the week feels
Okay because if you spend all week thinking its Monday its not a fast week right
I keep thinking its later in the week than it is but I cant tell if that makes the week long or short
Except Friday I guess
You would have spent almost the whole week thinking it was a fast week
Like say on each day you only realize at the end that it isnt Friday
So like overall did the week feel fast
But in the moments when you thought it was already Friday the week should feel short
My day off is usually Tuesday
Because the realization that its earlier in the week than you thought would presumably make the week feel longer
long
Guys if you thought every day of the week was Friday would the week feel long or short
Like thats veeeery specific
One of my cousins started at google this year and works on frontend mobile UI for google hotels
I applied to a lot of big companies before but to my knowledge they start you very small
Applications*
I make hololens and magicleap applicatione
No @Thao Nguyen lol i work on tiny baby projects as the only contributor uwu
But overall I think it ticks a lot of boxes in terms of fun, storytelling, and emotional impact
The story is also pretty interesting / fresh imo but I dont wanna say anything that could be spoilers
The premise of going into the internet has easy potential to become cringy or out of touch, but I thought it was well executed
I enjoyed it a lot
Was it good?
There were so many sequences that were just pure fun
I cant get over Ralph breaks the internet
Ive heard universally good things about Blindspotting and mostly good things about Blackkklansman
has anyone actually seen blindspotting or blackkklansman
Incredibles 2

This year had some good stuff
wait my movie of the year is DEFINITELY sorry to bother you
i can barely remember other movies i watched this year cause my perception of this year is so bad
not now but a few months ago
Did you actually break the site?
Its my movie of the year
wreck it ralph 2 was pretty good
o god how do i get rid of the thumbnail
i dont have to imagine cause i submitted code to people.com and broke the site when there was millions of users in traffic
Thats the plot of wreck it ralph 2
imagine submitting a pr to amazon that has a bug and you destroy the site
wait paul do you work on something like that
Help me sell my cotton candy makers
That and that people do math by hand
I think about that way too much for being a business major

It's insane
And people made editing software that abstracts those walls of text
Video editing and photo editing is also crazy like those files are just a massive wall of text that makes frames
When I started CS I was like damn someone made programming libraries that we use. Like they made methods that we use to make methods.
Like someone had to make Maya
Do you ever stop and wonder how big industry software programs work
it's crazy that double decker buses have 2 floors and stairs like what if they got so tall we had cars with elevators
Ask what would Allen do
Say you went to the dentist
It just seems like a redundant exchange but maybe Im supposed to say something else
I dont see an issue
Maybe the problem stems from my part in the exchange
Sometimes I have conversations with my Chinese relatives where its like I come home and then   Them: Youre home? Me: Yeah Im home. Them: Ah.  And I dont really question it but I dont understand either
Now thats big brain
It's cool how fog literally acts like render distance

In Chinese it's like aiyoh lol
Babies cry
so do you need to have no language to express the pure pain sound
Yeah different languages definitely have different pain words that you can internalize
ouch in viet is dao and my mom says that sometimes with a clear D
people say it for mental pain
No one says ouch
and I never resolved that question
I used to wonder if saying ow / ouch is learned
like if americans yell aaaaaaaaa do british people yell different
one time my 6th grade teacher said americans say umm but british people say emm or erm cause of the natural speaking positions of their mouths like the whole british accent thing
strictly speaking it shouldn't really be a verb
Gotta clean up my nut
because the term is bust a nut but now people just say nut
it's technically the object of the action
Nah you refer to loads as a nut
its only the action
and no one calls semen or sperm nut
Even then sperm and semen are different
it's probably not very accurate but I suppose it's still in the top percentile of words by which you could refer to semen as far as rational meaning goes
isnt a seed literally an egg
Why is it called fertilization then
The egg is arguably the seed
it definitely isn't fertilizer
You release fertilizer
I'm not joking lol isn't that the etymological basis
Is seed even an accurate description
you release seed when you nut
like the other definitions of nuts are like seed
how did nut even come to mean that
Encapsulate
exactly
but that's only because nut was defined to mean male orgasm
I'd say that's as close of an approximation as can be reached with current strats
a male orgasm is a nut
like it's an extremely high number of words like paragraphs about weird bodily feelings and in the end it makes no sense still
fuck
and furthermore assuming that this concept isn't some weird anomaly there's potentially an incredibly vast expanse of thought territory that has yet to be reached through verbal expression
what about when there's reddit threads of guys explaining to girls what male orgasm is like and vice versa
but I don't know how to begin to describe it
the reaction to the Odyssey thing is something you can feel in your head
my emotion for that is just wait what
is that like space
isn't it weird
wait what
even if you expanded into like words from other languages
Anyway the two main things I need words for are that and when the guy was the same age as his daughter
fuuuuuk i actually can't express it lmfao
Because it's somewhat similar to disappointment but way more complicated
The emotion of seeing a runner in cap kingdom is too hard to express with existing words
but the thing itself can be expressed with a different combination of words even if there isn't a single word for it
because you could say there should be a word for a pink lamp right
and the reason I need a word for this is because I don't think I can even adequately convey the feeling with a different combination of words
and the main instance when I think about it is when I open an Odyssey speedrun stream and the streamer is in the first 30 seconds of cap
has anyone seen memento
like umm no
You always put the right words to em tho
like imagine in batman if batman died and he was still alive and they were like yea there were 2 batmans the whole time
I was talking to Chris about this
How you just gonna be killing your own clones
sometimes I think about things that need words
straight up 2 batmans
Like wtff
It just happens
Yeah cloning is dumb
that was some cheese
the spoiler part of how they did the big trick in prestige was soooo dumb/weird lmao
but yeah I'd say inception is accepted
but in a good way I think
I can't accept interstellar
no one cares about nolan movies before dark knight
Maybe inception
batman and wolverine are magicians and it's so weirdly prominent in philosophical discussions
I still don't think people accepted interstellar
Idk nolan's movies tend to blow people's minds
like how can society accept its existence so readily
i frequently describe it as batman vs wolverine and no one gets it
the prestige is so good
Not least of which is that it was an unironic magician Batman vs Wolverine
like actually what does it mean
Is such an anime fundamental lol
i still don't understand wave particle duality
Energy cannot be created or destroyed
There's such a weirdly high amount of things to talk about in the prestige
Waves or particles
Electrons man
and lightning/plasma is when they get so much energy that they separate from the nucleus entirely
Yo cloning was pretty wack
fire is when electrons absorb enough energy that they go into a new electron shell
In my philosophy class we had all these thought experiments about the prestige and shit
lightning is like when the electrons are more free
Is identity determined by function or does everything have to be the same to have the same identity
So wait shit
But jesus rises
Ice is def the son
No because they have different functions
Also is ice the father or the son
Like do they have 1 identity
Because would you consider ice and water to be fundamentally the same thing
Into fire or lightning
Imagine being able to change the nature of energy
I was going to use the water / ice thing to pivot to identity philosophy actually
What is energy
like lightning
flame is energy

What is a flame
During my brief time in Christian school my bible studies teacher said that if Jesus and God being the same person but also being father and son was confusing to think of water and ice
What element is lightning
Hydrogen fire
I said water so many times that the word looks weird to me now
Or if there was a different word for h2o
But if liquid water was called something besides water it would make more sense
i get it
Idk how to articulate this clearly
But it also is just water
Like, ice is frozen water
Because of this I feel there are weird gray areas / blind spots in referring to water
i wonder if you could artificially create a molecule as op as water
Or the liquid form I mean
I dont think people would contest that but it seems awkward categorically because the water form of water is also water
Ice is water right
Also like on the subject of water
Omg I accidentally opened pandora and got sucked into the past
what if i throw an ice cube
Any water that lowers in altitude is rain
it's like almost basic rain
the water dripping in caves isnt rain cause it's in a cave but it's basic water
Its white girl tears
it's called alkaline rain
there's basic rain
Pumpkin spice latte rain
I 100% asked that 8 years ago
LOOOL
Is there basic rain
Water with a lower pH balance
It sounds like some low effort sci fi shit
That sounds like an apocalyptic concept
Although I dont really understand what acid rain even is
Thats part of why I wondered about this
A c i d r a i n
Isnt that what acid rain is
acid rain but it's oj
Market that and sell it
Like if you evaporate enough orange juice there should be a mass of gaseous orange somewhere
only water forms clouds cause of its strong intermolecular bonds making it stay close to each other
definitely not in the clouds
Other things should make their own clouds
It could only find its true self when it lost everything it had
if it has the same evaporating point then it goes into the air too
Are they in the clouds or just vaguely in the air
It's like it reassembles itself in the wake of its departing friend
But like the things that evaporate before or at the same time as water need to go somewhere
It's crazy that the salt becomes solid
I think it explodes
idk whatever dye is made of but it'd separate
And then heated the whole thing up
If you made a clay ball with a hollowed out core in the middle and filled that up with water then sealed it up
What about dye
if you have salt water and evaporate it then you'll have solid salt left
it stays there
But then where do the things go
in chem class you isolate molecules with different boiling points by evaporation
Yeah thao is right
But it's too hard 
Science is so cool conceptually
wait nothing evaporates along with water lol, every molecule evaporates separately
Yo i would have failed chemistry in high school if my girlfriend wasn't a chem major lol
~H~ O.  O
H O.   O
H20!?
H20
Lol yeah
Like in the things that burn
It makes me angry how special water is
That when it heats up there isn't a super excessive release of energy
I think it's the fact that water is soo stable
Most things burn by default
And all elements come from these high pressure star forges
I think because stars are plasmatically burning
Unless like most things are metals idk
Time for some labbing
It feels like a minority
Or the minority
Can the majority of things melt
Cause that still makes no sense lol
It could save itself from melting but not others
Ironic
Like, i wanna know what makes something able to burn versus melt
Or paper
It's interesting that wood can't melt
Man fuck physics
Does it have to go up to evaporate or just become gas
The matter change from solid to gas is called sublimation
It's also flammable
Theoretically
Can you evaporate anything?
Oil evaporates faster than water
I guess because the rain cycle is its own thing
Idk why Im framing this as though evaporation is a process unique to water
I think that's how rock candy is made
Or like the sugar in water and things like that
Go boil some red water in a pot and see what color the steam is
Or does it stay
Where does the red go when it rains
That'd be a fun experiment
With blood
Isn't that just heaven
Well what if I dyed the ocean red
Or what might happen is the water drains out first then rises
It goes to water heaven
I think it gets left behind
And rises
The water just becomes so unstable it turns into invisible gas
Okay but like what happens to the stuff that isnt just water when it evaporates
Cause it's not like you can see droplets flying up
I don't know if you can actually measure the "strength" of evaporation
I thought you meant a ball of wet sand was fun
Probably a lot of dust particles
Question
That's a fun situation
So is there a boundary of what can evaporate along with water
Things that have more atomic more incomplete valence shells/ atomic bonds don't retain solid or liquid forms as well
But if you have a ball of wet sand only the water would evaporate
What I mean is something like orange juice can entirely evaporate right
Molecular stability which determines boiling point
Is it related to viscosity or like the extent to which something is bonded with water
What determines what can and cant evaporate
Like does water store heat to the point it turns into a gas
I find it weird that it evaporates by just existing
shits crazy
like clouds just are big white things floating in the sky
and now its dry
i had a wet paper towel in my pocket this morning
isnt it crazy that water just evaporates
Freeze is only good cause frozone
Youre right and it makes me mad
Like in theory theres a whole world of bad puns out there but I feel in practice theres no more devastating combination of words than ice to meet you
How come ice puns are there corniest
Its a buffered airdodge finish
lmfao imagine the pic was mistimed
Like those people are probably literally good at teching
Imagine the tech skill required to take the photo
it makes sense to me cause i only see it in kids movies where they take a photo
Photo finish is some item get phrasing
It sounds like engrish
I thought because it was close it made a good photo lol
It's a finish so close you have to review the footage to tell who won
cause of like kid movies where theres literally a photo finish and the announcer says its a photo finish
at least i knew photo finish was a close finish
That's a good explanation too
thats something i didnt understand for a long time
A bird in the hand is worth two in the Bush
I guess I thought it meant a finish that looks photogenic
Its one of those phrases you can hear a lot but never have to consider what it means
I never thought about it before
What did you think it meant?
Man I just found out what photo finish means lol
Nah its better when we can match theirs with a button push
Its better when they match your speed
Its better if there is an option to match like red dead redemption
Because then it just takes longer
@Chris is it better if they move at your walk speed
Adjectives or Chris looking like an asshole
Damn never thought about it like that
Just be interesting
And its such a cheap way to get people to not zone out
Because I just look like an asshole running than skidding than running than skidding
It pisses me off when npcs cant be matched in run speed
No ima counter this
reposting

But I see this expressed every so often
https://twitter.com/GamepIay/status/1067114083202273281
This was the tweet that I just saw
That's a good point
Without also being really slow
I just dont understand why people hone in on when the NPCs move at a speed where you can regulate how close you are to them
The enjoyability of escort objectives is dubious for sure
Like trailing missions in Assassin's Creed are laughably horrible
Sure? Honestly I don't remember the last time I've enjoyed anything involving following or escorting or whatever with an NPC
That would mean the only acceptable speed is your walk speed
I mean it's not worse than those things but it still sounds pretty bad
hold me back

How is that worse than either being slower than your walk or faster than your run
It makes me unreasonably angry when I see people complain about the npcs faster than your walk but slower than your run thing
those prices though :eyes:
But i still thought it was such a bizarre way to list them
Lol it took me a while to realize but those are all just options
i prefer american
I love eating the English
this has to be out of context lol

Wasnt chocolate royalty exclusive
Like there arent gourmet artisan gummies
How come theres such a broad range of how classy chocolate can be but that doesnt exist for any other candy
political forecasts that favor dems :(
the senate forecast :(

THIS MEME WAS MADE  MADE BY SHIT SHOVELER GANG
Shit shovler Shit shovler
can cali get a blue gay shit shoveler gov
Things look good for our blue gay shit shoveler gov tho
Depends on which part of Colorado so this midterm actually matters quite a bit.
Wait its blue Normally. And yeah i did
justin youre voting in washington?
Colorodo goes red i thought?
yea which is why its important
Idk what maps are accurate
Isn't florida also neither
Its a green state
vote tess for supreme leader
we need tess to fix florida
Like neither one nor the other strongly
Colorado is a gray state it seems

Omw
Paul save the future
Oh wait Paul
If only someone can vote in a red state
but at least im voting via my mom so like its better than nothing
Im voting NJ
i procrastinated too long to get a mail-in ballot, someone send me to the gulag
I voted 
I'm not voting
andy are u voting
Remove the sad
Seriously ignore the title its not a sad thing
oh ok nice lol
Ignore the title this is a good article on whats on the ballot
https://medium.com/@memosalazar/its-2018-and-new-york-still-doesn-t-care-about-your-vote-e9513bc2aea0?fbclid=IwAR1UtxRe7zhoRWvziNGe6s8E06VEEDEFt8qllH8YHIDlaYNDk2Urx94CSl8
like im voting in cali, pauls voting in colorado, i imagine youre voting in ny and actually maybe @Julian Hermano or @Barry Tessler might also be voting in ny?
Wait what do you mean
like it actually doesnt look like it basically
is anyone in this chat voting in the same state as someone else
everyone vote for ocasio cortez if youre voting in ny or we'll all die
this is like a good chat for discussing what ppl are voting on actually
btw everyone vote
I feel like everything only makes sense because time can pass and because things can end
Imagine how little emotion there would be in an existence without impermanence
Theres biological life and like existential life
I watched or read something a while ago where the message was that anything that can end has a life
What does it even mean to be alive really
but like in the opposite way
Those things are almost converging on the boundary between life and death
someone whos alive and basically not is like someone in a coma or something
a zombie is dead but basically not
That sounds like a zombie
what if the opposite of a zombie is like someones whos alive but like basically not
I think alive and dead can be opposites in the same instance dead and undead are
Something that was never alive
Then whats the opposite of a living thing
Undead and Dead
Yes
Is the opposite of a zombie a corpse
the plan has been compromised
the ship has been compromised
Depends on the contex
Actually

It's interesting that compromise is good but getting compromised is bad
Im confused
Help

Optionality is a word I hear it in my finance classes whenever we talk about option trading
Obliged sounds southern to me
Except you dont say much obligated
I always thought they were basically the same meaning but idk
Do those mean the same thing
Or obligated
Obliged?
You are obliged to return the favor
The opposite of oblige could be discourage?
You can still use it imo
Like the state of being elective
Doesn't matter
Is electivity a word
And what is the opposite of that
What does obligatory/ obliged mean
Lol
Unrequiredness
I guess you can say despite it not being necessary...
Inconsequentiality?
Inconsequential?
Despite the ______ of brushing your teeth, you should still do it anyway.
How about this
Disposable?
I think there must be a cleaner way to say the lack of necessity though that Im just not thinking of
Which might be why we can say things negatively instead lol
Now that I think about in a lot of these situations its hard to say the negative thing in one word
It might depend on your reason for not wanting it
It'll ruin everything
Don't bring that, it's a _______
Like the opposite of I need this
Like
Like how to you say don't even want
My question is beyond that even
Or not need in one word
An opposite of need
Thats basically what my question was
Because there are a lot of things that need, but using them requires expending them, right?
What's the opposite of need
It doesnt seem like a clean division to me
And some as expendables
You could describe some things as necessities
But if you were making a list of things
I just wondered if there was a word that worked there
Yeah its easy enough to reword
Rather than using a positive word
Well in that scenario you would just say it's not a necessity
Because you cant expend it right?
Yeah but if you dont have it, its not expendable
Cause theoretically everything that's not necessary is expendable
I think you have to define the extremes then
You wouldnt say nah theyre expendable right?
As in say someone asks you if they need to bring supplies to your event
Yeah but if you dont have it, it might not be necessary, but its not expendable
I have it, but i don't need it, so i can get rid of it
Yeah
Is there really a difference
That means you can get rid of it, not that you dont need to have it
Expendability?
The opposite of necessity
Instead of a noun?
So necessity as an adjective?
I wanted a word for like the necessity of purpose except the opposite of necessity
Expendable
Is optionality a word?
Whats the opposite of necessity
And this was a Chinese restaurant so the odds of receiving that were slim
But I guess if I had to imagine vegetable soup I would think minestrone
I didnt think a lot about it
Well
What did you expect and what did you get
You can ask and they'll tell you
I got vegetable soup from a restaurant and what it was surprised me a little and then I realized it really could have been anything
Theres not a lot of soups that couldnt be called vegetable soup
The reddit thread about this challenge without the November part is 90 days
Like surprisingly nothing happens
Bra the first one after a month things just turn back to normal
The least I could make it work was twice in 1 month
Honestly if you can succeed you're transcendent
it's as big or little brained as the first orgasm you get after it ends
Is nonutnovember big brained or little brain
but I still have to see if my friends can get me a ticket
I think I'm going to an animation show
how bout sunday
i'm going to the studio ghilbi orchestral concert!
u wanna watch perfect blue with me and tess on saturday
lets go watch a movie
if you can confuse 2 dogs of the same breed then they have less variation then humans
even naked
and the people have way more variation
and a group of dogs
you can take a group of people of the same race
anyway
why not
Clothes dont count
can make different peoples look mad distinct
skin color and hair and even clothing
idk
I think its more noticeable with dogs because their hair covers their whole body lol
there are LOTS of races
well breeds are like races
And then dogs
If a bug has 3 spots on its back instead of 2 its probably a different species
but dogs are getting close
I always thought it was weird how like
people definitely
Do dogs or people have more variation
Thered probably some poorly made ones involving the hand chopping a button
both tennis and testicles
like balls
I think theyd meme about stuff like their instinct to chase after things
balls
what do you think dogs would meme about
Maybe just show the dog memes to begin with
you can make a lot of memes just using images if you want and they'd still be funny
memes are easier to understand than language
and feel like theyre part of a community laughing together
I think youre gonna overwhelm the dog if you introduce memes that fast
you dont need to be funny to make a meme but everyone can do it
thats why memes work
jokes are funnier when more people think they are funny
this stimulates and delights our brains, and makes us feel part of a group
9. German

usually derived from things that subvert expectations or reveal something about the world in an unexpected way
Ah got it
a subversion of the mind
@Andy how would you explain the concept of humor
Maybe Julius could do it
Like imagine explaining to a dog why something is funny
Isnt it weird that humor exists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGj15uvuPLA
Rip Acrids run btw
Im not super surprised that hes in the discord but Ive never seen him talk there before
He's also a big watcher of mario64 runs much like other melee players
I think all my life decisions lead up to seeing Armada chat in the odyssey speedrunning discord
He's been playing it a lot since release and he just quit a huge part of his life so I'm not surprised
What a world
@Paul Merritt @Chris Colon

Hopefully

I think it does
i dont actually know
wait
KO punch goes away right
airdodge is so committal in ult and that was his best recovery option
Hes bad in smash 4 and I still almost lose to every mac I play
his recovery is so bad in ultimate
Hes the one character that would make me mad if he was good I think
thats like impossible though
Guys my actual biggest fear for Ult is little mac being good
most of his stuff is just option covering
exactly
Side b
What 3 hit combo does cloud have
or most of diddy resets
not bayo/cloud combos
And thats like most smash 4 combos
Then dk doesnt count
okay maybe we shouldnt count two hit combos
Chair downb
Bair down b while were here
I thought nair downb was bigger cuz nair is so good vs ledge
I feel needles down b is pretty big
lately its been more reads
Fox
Sheik
like what character wins off of starting a true combo besides dk and bowser
And at least some of that has to come from Mario
Ill concede that both Ally and Anti are really good at rattling people
true combos are unviable
But you could say that about most things he does
The way anti does dtilt fsmash definitely isnt true
Or like maybe I did it at high percent too but not the mid range
Idk why
Now that I think about it I dont try it past low %
So they just fall
Its hard to get
But I think i almost always do it when theyre too low percent
Dtilt fsmash and dtilt fair are true sometimes
When I get the dtilt I usually never get anything out of it
Its pretty good
He fishes for it at the right percent
Actually
Yeah like antis 2 frame dtilt fsmash lol
Thats how sometimes they just die
People get scared in mario combos too though
Even if you theoretically know how to SDI
I feel like you need a lot of experience to not just panic when youre getting laddered
Which contributes to things like dying from SDIing up
And people get really scared in bayo combos
She doesnt even have to use it
The existence of witch time pressures you
It just feels like she has less frames but that doesnt equate to pressure
Im asking What does bayo pressure with
As an ike main
Like Cloud Bayo Diddy Fox are pretty scary
The scariest he gets is when hes spamming usmash
Im saying Mario is definitely good but he doesnt have as much pressure as other top tiers
As insane as smash 4 allows though lol
Also a lot of the pressure is insane if someone presses shield

Also DK because if a DK cares enough to pummel you theyre putting you in ding dong range
Yeah I was gonna say lucario
Lucario
Who has the most tilting pummel
Marios pummel
I can invalidate falco with pummel
And falco with nair
You can definitely invalidate Kirby with spaced bair
In that sense it exerts pressure on you
Like Pac-Man up b doesnt kill but its a important move you have to respect and keep in mind
Not necessarily for killing
Theyre good tools but not ones that you can heavily exploit or use to invalidate bad characters
As in for killing?
Theyre low impact and pressure
Low impact?
Dair might be top tier
Mario aerials are mostly just low impact
Yes
Mewtwo fair is top tier
All of Marios aerials are top tier
Ult Mario though
Thanks for coming to my ted talk
Lol
As if it was like a 0 mana draw a card
But the lack of opportunity cost makes it good
On an absolute level fludd isnt great
So the difference in effectiveness is like fludd vs nothing compared to say sheik fair vs nair
But in a lot of situations where fludd has value its the only reasonable action
What I like about fludd is that with most moves, no matter how good they are, youre using them at the cost of another move you could be using there
I think dair and fludd can be good for that but yeah he doesnt have like a corrin sideb for low tiers
Imo fludd might be his best move but that might be a bad opinion
Theres usmash but eh
Which hurts his ability to outclass low tiers imo

And also he doesnt have many top tier moves
Doc Ness tho
Where he has a lot of advantages but is weirdly vulnerable to most bullshit
Yeah
I think its like sheik factor but in a different way
Mario Ness is up there too
I know wtf
o yeah i mean s4 side b
Yeah thats just most mario mus for some reason lol
For the longest time i thought mario wins kinda free but its actually more even than i thought
No its like as hard for Samus as it should be
On both ends
Mario Samus is harder than it has any right to be
Melee*
Meler sideb is like so viable tho
Hes been washed for 17 years alone
HugS has been playing melee samus competitive for the last 17 years and still does it
every time i press side b i want to quit
He said every Samus stands at the same distance and does side b charge shot and thinks theyre so smart and it never works but then he played Samus and found himself doing it and it didnt work
Did he subtweet me
Nope
Paul did you see Fallns Samus tweet that one time
Same with s4
64 samus ledgehop fair is like unpunishable tho lol
64 samus basically doesn't exist
No sideb and no tether to ledge
i hate them
Smash 64 samus feels like 1/3 a char tho
I like them too
I like both characters a lot lol
wft is actually 1/3 of a character
yea that's true
Samus is way more normal than wft
But I love it
Samus is like a zoner/boxer hybrid. Super weird
actually that's what wft feels like
Dash attack to anything is the truth
like it feels like you're playing with 1/3 of a character
Like across all smashes i probably use kirby the least anyhow
my samus is so bad i don't understand how samus is a character
As long as I only up b to recover
My smash 4 pika isnt that bad
She's the 9th character in s64
No
wait does puff count
samus is definitely my least played
I played some pika in 64
Idk how much that counts lol
I played a lot of Kirby in 64
For me that might be pika or kirby
I considered yoshi since you start with the original 8 characters in ult and I think yoshi might be the one Ive played least
I did it with guest f and its hype
i need to invest in my pika for pikachu libre
I wanna do jab run through reverse usmash
Jab nair is hype
Itd be more of an investment for ult than anything else
jab nair feels good
And definitely not for the other person
But also not
Yoshi is really fun
I feel like Yoshi is close enough to guest f that I can do alright lol
Yeah
Paul remember yoshi vs sheik
he seems really easy anyways
But Im not sure how long I can hold on
And Im trying to fight it
Ive had the urge to learn yoshi
Speaking of YF
when simon was just simon on the pr
The young father
yo i remember yf
He still is sketch
Yeah
We just didnt know what YF meant
Max was definitely an enigma for a while
No?
Be more specific
Was it YF
There are definitely several
Wait who was the person who was a meme because we didnt know what he looked like
why is wai fu
i remember think who tf is wai fu and why
O lol yeah
Like we didnt really know who she was except that there was someone called wai fu
ROB has no concept of defense
Wasnt Tess kellam for like her first semester
allen snake is the #1 tank
We need Kellam
We need some tanks in NSM
And dabuz told me I have no concept of defense
I remember bankai told Thao her defense was lacking
Lol
Wasnt he the guy that tried a terrorist on a plane prank
One of his pranks was about pretending to be a secret drug addict
He also got involved in a huge controversy from one of his pranks right
i remember at the same tourney when i lost to bankai in the zss mirror game 1 and then went mario and he said my mario is way better than my zss and my zss is bad
Unrelated to smash
But in addition to that he had a large YouTube following
And might still
Well he did
wait so he doesnt play smash
I got pranked
I lost to a puff at nebs and then I found out he was a YouTube prankster
Do yoshi mains become depressed about everything?
like are puff mains better at taking hardship? do they have stronger will?
It ruined Sinji for one thing
or if it does
Im trying to think how maining a character for 4 years of the game changes you as a person
@Chris say your point
imagine if someone was young you
I cant refute this
I
And hes been getting good so I think he can be roughly as good as numbers in early ult
Like vivi is totally young numbers
All the dip and dots are connecting
WAIT
Wait
Vivi ult wft inc
He was trying him in early smash 4 too

Yeah
Lucario right?
Do you know who numbers mained in brawl
Actually you first
Interesting digression but...
I have a theory
That reminds me
I feel like if I mained lucario for all of sm4sh my mindset would be so cancerous
Dair feels decent
except bair
or feels bad
i feel like literally every lucario move is bad
Thats my only real issue
I'm not furry i swar
If he had a normal up b Id prob play him
lucario feels so bad
I like his footsies
I think I can make high pressure comebacks decently well and lucario is good for that but hes just so laggy and I hate every aspect of his up b
Does that mean you wish you can be a furry?
Speaking of which I wish I could play lucario lol
*insert introspectives what your character says about you video*
@Rahul
Whereas in smash you can simply pick lucario
Like its harder to out yourself as a furry in other fighters
Like Im sure I would perceive more individuality in other fighters if I understood them better but as is I dont see as much room for variation
I think smash allows more self expression than traditional fighters but Im not sure
Yeah its also a cool form of self expression
Yeah but no other game type can really have that effect besides like a shooter
You can just say chuuni for short
Lol
SDX is only good because he is a chunibiyo or whatever its called
But even if you dont I think the whole aspect of training and facing off against people is exhilarating
SDX
@ me
Like some people get really anime about it obviously
But playing a fighter lets you have vicarious warrior / fighter experiences while still safely being a nerd
Instead of being something like a mario cart or battle royale I guess
Also theres no non cringe way to put this
But the thinking and sensations that go into competitive smash are pretty unique especially since I dont really compete in other outlets
Do you think smash being a fighting game drives that
With other genres I enjoy them a lot but for the most part I wouldnt be missing out on anything if I didnt play them
I feel like it taps into a whole world of thoughts and emotions that I wouldnt ever experience without playing a fighter
Like of playing the game itself, not counting the community or social interactions or anything
What?
You know what I appreciate most about smash
Or nostalgia
Because then they would both have the sentimentality buff
So in 10 years its easily possible that one of the smash games could beat out Paper Mario even with nothing changing externally
That said I dont think sentimentality scales linearly with time
id say the second paper mario should do the trick
But like it takes something more
Yeah
Its pretty hard because like Im sure Ive played other games for longer and enjoyed them more too lol
the first paper mario?
Im trying to think what it would take to supplant Paper Mario as my favorite game
Not necessarily
isnt the more recent competition attempting to fill a different niche?
The assumption isnt that games get worse over time, its that theres more competition over time
but some games got better
also a lot of this is assuming every game gets worse over time
that is true andy , i do say that a lot actually lol
I think I was initially confused because I thought you were presenting that as the main draw
I definitely get it as a bonus good thing
Ah noted
Yeah thats all I was saying lol
But 1 is a bonus good thing in that it was innovative
Sure
They dont but 2 includes 1
FFVI is both:  1. Better than Star Ocean or whatever RPGs were out at the time 2. Still a better than average RPG now   These things dont contradict one another
If Im being unclear Ill try amending it
But then if its both its good and less good than average now
dang chris always saying games he hasnt even played are bad
Even though everything I said does not explain why Mario Galaxy is my favorite
Nightmare in Dreamland is such a fire game
Good for its time carries the connotation that its less good than average now but was remarkable when it came out
I feel people have stupid reasons like that for liking games, so when the gaming scene shifts, they cant connect as well since their preference hasnt shifted
I think youre conflating good for its time and better than games around it
If cant not be good for its time if its good though
yo what an origin story
It can be both
Because when I was really young I had no understanding of memory cards, and did not know when memory cards were in the system or not so like sometimes I hit save and it would work and sometimes it wouldnt. Also was too young to read menus so a lot of times I would just start new game by accident every play session. So games that were good despite all that really resonated with me. SA2 and nightmare in dreamland were so good for that which is why I love those games
Im saying if it still holds up its just good rather than good for its time if that makes sense
God what a run on sentence
Standing the test of time is more important than being better than average of the time but that doesnt mean being a marvel when it came out was insignificant
If its still better I feel like it matters less that it was ahead of its time
It was good for its time and is still better than 11-15
I mean both I like it for a lot of reasons
Julian are you saying you prefer 6 because it was good relative to its time or because you like it better than newer entries
See like my preference of game can never be recreated in the modern gaming scene
And the plots are more convoluted
Theyre all shorter now
General consensus about Final Fantasy games is they havent been as good as the middle of the series lifespan for a while
Well none of that means anything cause it's all relative
^
Also just because the average is better doesnt mean the best is better
Ima post it in bops
Dude the water music is so good
But he sold me
Like i aint even heard of that nonsense Chris just made up
Thats amazing
The first boss is Rock Paper Scissors
Average game now
Yeah but the average game is much better than average games from 10-20 years ago
Bra you ever played Alex Kidd in miracle world
FE5 is a much more interesting game mechanically than Awakening
Also system strength getting better doesnt necessarily mean gameplay gets better
Tess didnt like crawl though 
He genuinely enjoys what he enjoys so much lmao
Chris makes any game he likes fun
Because the game 10 years later gave me something Ive already done
But whatever I play first will always be better
I agree with that
Id hopefully say they are the same
The extent to which when the game came out matters
Im confused about this hypothetical and what youre getting at
*6
How would you feel
Or 6
But one came out 10 years earlier
Vi?
Hypothetically if you played two games that were the same
I played VI pretty recently though
If that makes sense
I think it might be more accurate to compare how much you enjoy it at the time vs how much you enjoy modern games
Like I respect FFVI for being so ahead of its time even though there are better games so its probably my favorite FF
I think considering how a game stands against games of its time can factor in so its not pure quality
Same for movies to a lesser extent
I feel like its weird because games get so much better but nostalgia is so strong
But I like it
Ill never play it
I like it
does anyone like spore
No
Oh
Like in the population?
Everyone
For who?
Wait is spore the current favorite
Like spore
It would have to be some revolutionary game with so much effort put in
So far I dont think any game that comes out can be my favorite
Its different with like books because theyve been around lol
Despite the fact that the overall quality of games increases at a pretty fast pace
I havent beaten Vi yet though
So @Chris do you think its unlikely youll play a game that becomes your favorite
Vi came out 4 years ago though
Over 10 years ago
How recent is everyones favorite game
I see your point
But if your 1 years old none of them would be
Right but if youre like 10 years old you could watch 10 random movies and theres a good chance one could be your new favorite
Because nostalgia drives tastes more as you age, and moving on to something new would be harder
Because you can recognize quality and compare things on a technical as well as emotional level
Harder
Easier I think
Human Wu's Father added Paul Merritt to the group.
Does it become harder or easier to find new favorite movies/games/etc as you get older
Text the hedgehog new OC
But they have varying speeds depending on connection
Absolutely
Do texts travel faster than sound
there are other ways??
Fellas ya ever eat a dick sideways
burEEET
Gotta hold all of that burrite
I never think about like... holding just one end of it
Ima try sideways next time
When I eat a chipotle burrito I just try and hold as much of it in my grip as tightly as possible so it doesn't unfold and fall apart
Arent they interchangeable
Then imagine holding the other end of it and biting the other side
Okay imagine holding a taco and biting it
Wait there are different ways?
off to get a chipotle burrito and hold it the wrong way rn
yo sideways tho
im always holding like the far end
Like you can hold the near end or the far end
Wait sideway
I mean taco
Its scary
You guys ever hold a burrito the opposite way
Donald and Goofy were there too
I thought my memory was good but then a dude in a black robe stuck me in a castle and threw a lot of cards at me and told me nothing was real and I believed him
Which, in general, is a weird evolutionary aspect of humans
Both are interesting, but i think the second one is so much more interesting to me. It means the average human brain has the capacity of photographic memory and recognition, but on average people dont have photographic memories
Maybe other ways too
Both
or both
As in taking a second and remembering said second for years or as in vivid memories being so vivid you remember every second like a minute?
The possibility of taking a limited memory, and stretching it to extend forever, or at least as close to it as you can get
Thats pretty neat
As if within the domain of your memories, its you who has power over time, rather than the other way around
Like because of the unreliability of human memories, time that you remember can be more or longer than the time you had in actuality
Depends on the memory of course
Correct, unless remembered to reremember (i.e. moving old floppy disks over to new flash drives) even that which is recorded is forgotten
But in some limited instances I think that memory can be stronger than time
And time eats those up eventually too
But the capacity to remember, which is artificially bolstered by recording as you say, offsets the way time just erases everything
Time is one of the few things we havent and probably wont tame
Alongside writing/recording
Because I think time basically rules everything
In a way its the only weapon people have against time
Memory is really interesting
EW
https://youtu.be/SG3TcgM0NCs
Lmao thats actually me. Tho, what happened in palo alto?
Yeah Im gonna talk about Palo Alto 2012 until dementia pries it from my cold amnesiac hands
So maybe i forget in 2 days, but part of living is talking about your life
That one day to me is the time I'm generally already so excited i want to talk about it
1 day imo
At what point would it just be forgotten as a normal memory anyway
How long do you have to remember it for it to be worthwhile?
But what if the memory was fixed to last 10 days or 10 weeks, etc
It doesnt feel worth it, right?
Say you can pay a good amount of money to do something you really enjoy, but you wont retain memory of it
So like
Compared to the fact that something happened which is timeless
To an extent
The thing is though memories themselves are impermanent right
I feel, but i guess this brings us full circle in the impact of limiting your memory of an area by not "living in the moment"
But on memory
I was a teenager and I was mostly salty about having bad internet in the countryside lol
I should have appreciated my time in France more
Cest la vie
Paris i was in when it was 95 and i wanted to die lol
What about Paris
I didnt make it to bordeaux just nice and marseilles
Near Bordeaux
What part?
I spent a couple summers in Southern France
I feel the memory of my midnight walk is more clear than the pictures, which speaks i think to the fact I dont have pictures. So your point of dilluting the experience has merit
Nice
Nice a year ago
Where in France were you
I feel like it changes if you are aware, then i feel the emotions are heavier
Yo my snapchat gives me annual reminders about my ex sometimes
Especially if youre aware that the present is the only chance youll have to feel / think about these things
I see
And funny you mention that, my phone just told me a year ago i was in France via when i took pictures, but I think the memories were more important than the pictures.
I think that not remembering can be similarly freeing in a different way
Partially because you dont feel obligated to use mental energy remembering stuff if you know you can just look at the pictures
I can see that. A "live in the moment" type of romance. That makes me ask if you'd do it
Like theres this whole thing about how it youre too preoccupied with taking photos on a trip / etc. it dilutes your experience
But I think theres something romantic about experiences that cant be remembered
It makes sense because memory is basically what tethers us to reality
I think people value memory really highly
Id argue no as an experience's value is its impact
So does an experience have any value if it isnt remembered and gets undone
True, i just dont think id be willing to do something for nothing
But there would be no cost either
Then probably not
Right
In said case there is no benefit to repeating right (
Suppose you dont
Yeah, do i know im repeating just not remember what happened?
Like do you know that youre repeating the day?
So say I say yes. Do i remember saying i want to choose a day, just not remember ever doing the day before?
What do you mean
Do i remember the day before where i choose the day?
Sure
Do i get to choose the day?
If you could live one day on repeat for like a 100 days but without retaining your memories on reset would you do it
Fair. But on average,.
Yeah but even then you could specify either most practical language to learn, easiest to learn, etc
Anyways, on the language thing. Id argue that you could say "best language to learn" but saying best language is just incorrect
Philosophy / discussions
Wait what chat is this so i know
Well my primary reference point is The Castle of Otranto (Walpole, 1764) so I guess that doesnt tell me much about pronunciations
A lot of pronunciations changed
Theres a lot of new words and words that became obsolete but that always happens I think
English hasnt changed substantially since America
yea that's definitely true
Its really subjective but it wants you to answer in an objective-sounding way
I also feel like when you frame a question along the lines of best or worse it passively reinforces the notion of someones opinion being fact
like was it full of inconsistencies in england
also i wonder if english was so messed up before america or not
But with most things its more useful to evaluate more specific criteria
In some contexts there actually is like a best character in the game
In general saying best or worst usually leads to poor conversations
Well the idea of there being a best language is silly to begin with but answering polylingualism is also pretty pretentious
the second guy is like subtweet shit talking the first guy
wait this thread is so heated https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-language-in-the-world-and-why
Though some people make a big deal about inconsistencies in the language, thats essentially like treating Americas cultural diversity as a negative
Its more of a byproduct of its popularity than anything inherent to the language itself but thats not something that can be considered in isolation anyway
I think English is the deepest and most interesting language
Well whats a good language
If you say a more than poor amount of something it could be less poor
english is trash
guess it depends on how you say it
actually i guess more than paltry is worse cause like more than poor is like poorer?
Its not on the list
Lets consult the list of adjectives that cant be modified
yes
So more than paltry is less paltry?
i feel like that sounds like "bad but like not that bad" ????
What about more than paltry
sounds bad to me
Is beyond paltry good or bad
Human Wu's Father added Justin Jones to the group.
Oh no
Whats your definition of own
Do we own our limbs
Ima find an exception
Like she might care about the baby and be responsible for it but thats not necessarily ownership
I would say no
Does a mom own her baby
Okay wait
But animals do get possessive
I say own because your right about not solely being able to own
Animals do own things
I think its interesting to consider because in a lot of stories there are characters who treat people in their lives as possessions or objects which usually connotes a lack of caring when in fact the ownership itself is literal attachment
But beyond that owning things is about feelings of attachment
Because on a practical level I guess people need the idea of ownership in order to deal with issues like stealing
Formed from laws and sentimentality
And it would follow that ownership is something of a social construct
I think most people would say no
Do animals own anything
Okay but the thing is
As you may recall the theme of ownership was discussed in Breakfast at Tiffanys
The former
Does anything truly solely belong to anyone or is ownership at least marginally distributed in all instances due to the inherent interconnectedness of this universe
It did not solely belong to him
Weve eaten the same collective food
Have you eaten his food

You can see songs
You can hear dances though
But that doesnt account for the visual component
Oh yeah
Well people usually say Ive heard this song and dance before
Disrespectively
As oppose to?
Ive heard and seen this song and dance before respectively
but living things have yet to truly need it
maybe they are
if brains were flaccid and got erect when you really needed it
Lol imagine if brains actually swelled or shrank drastically depending on your level of cognition

it might as well have just been sesame
Man half the password is just open

You can't replace it in open sesame for sure
De-tail
I don't think you can replace the word "open"
Of the entrails
Give me the entails
Entails if you will
The details of the entail
Give me information regarding that
but if it's a sentence with entail it's hard to replace
I mean you can rephrase anything to avoid saying a word

What do you mean

wtf
Omg fudge isnt chocolate
SOTN started the term
But if you take the average of what everyone considers essential to a metroidvania that should function relatively well as the bar for what can be considered a metroidvania
With acknowledgment of the fact that this is inherently a cultural term rather than a concept that can be objectively evaluated
Strictly define metroidvania
We can just call Pokmon go a metriod styled game
Which ruins the point
Because every metriod game is a metriodvania
And then I moved on to Pokmon go
Because I thought Pokmon is basically a metroidvania
I think we need a tighter definition
That was essentially my original point
Wait I feel like we can call most world games metriodvanias at this point with this definition
Undertale
Life is Strange
like not that but the reversion is the evolution
radiant historia
So while you can freely move between the rooms you can only enter each room in its static time
But theres a magic forcefield in each room that traps it in a different time period
Okay imagine that youre playing a Castlevania game
Is bravely default a metriodvania?
In Bravely Default the reversion is the evolution
Is D&D a metriodvania?
like not in general but in this case
i think its timeline-based whether or not its evolution or reversion
What have I done
Oh no
Distinguishing between evolution and reversion is an act of hubris
all of these metroidvania things apply to dark souls especially ds1
But the world doesnt evolve from going back it reverts
wait is dark souls a 3d metroidvania
Is it more explicit story?
You can access any area of the game when you want to
Im really trying to find out the castlevania part
I mean the timeline of the game is fairly arbitrary
Then no
Turning back time is the travel back
Like can I travel back?
Is there a way for me to go back to the rest of the game without turning back time?
By random drops from enemies or candles
Does vi count
You can get different weapons
They were point a to point b
o jk
No
castlevania games were also like that werent they?
Because the description is just a metriod game
Wait whats the castlevania part in metriodvania?
is metroid prime a metroidvania
I think not being 2D is the one thing that holds it back
Most game mechanics in real life are just real mechanics in games
Is the body just a controller for our brain
Its an augmented reality game
also you could argue rl has game mechanics
but thats like rl
Or a metro card to access new areas
You can get a bike or a car
wait what tools are there in pokemon go
But I think Wikipedia is wrong
If vvvvvv is actually a metriodvania than Ill give you Pokmon go
Pokmon go
Yeah but you know what game has special tools used to bypass obstacles
The entire game is open from the beginning with no lvl ups or item gets besides mcguffins
But there is no special tools used to bypass obstacles
And Im citing Wikipedia
Its on the list
Is vvvvvv a metriodvania?
Does vvvvvv have a boss
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Metroidvania_games
I guarantee at least one game here doesnt

But new category 3D metriodvania
Also Pokmon go isnt 2D
Every metriodvania has a final boss
Why does there have to be a final boss
So the answer is not yet
Not yet
There is no final boss in Pokmon go
Real life itself doesnt have concrete game mechanics
if pokemon go is a metroidvania, is rl a metroidvania
Metroidvania games generally feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, though access to parts of the world is often limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be passed once the player has acquired special items, tools, weapons or abilities within the game. Acquiring such improvements can also aid the player in defeating more difficult enemies and locating shortcuts and secret areas, and often includes retracing one's steps across the map. Through this, Metroidvania games include tighter integration of story and level design, careful design of levels and character controls to encourage exploration and experimentation, and a means for the player to become more invested in their player character. Metroidvania games typically are sidescrolling platformers, but can also include other genre types.
is it the backtracking
what makes it a metroidvania
Is Pokmon go a metroidvania
No

Enigma?
A conundrum?
or the object of your wondering
But specifically, what would be the best way to refer to something that you're wondering about
Right, since language is inherently arbitrary, anything could be valid or not
It's like the Mean Girls bit with "trying to make 'fetch' a thing." If describing things as "fetch" becomes a thing that people do frequently enough, then it becomes normal to describe things as "fetch"
I mean the meaning and usage of words is based on like... social stuff... so if that is a context in which "wonder" is frequently used... yeah, it would be accurate to use it in that context.
Like if you wonder what would happen if you press this button, is that question in your head a wonder?
Can you refer to something you wonder about as a wonder

Who did you take those aps for
Also I took 9 aps but was supposed to be 10
Thats bad design
Why did they say correct mid paragraph

Of course
did you only take it cause it was an ap
Wait do I count if I took ap psychology taught by a Rutgers professor and got Rutgers credit for it
P(psych class| college student) = 75%
i feel like 75% of college students have taken a psych class
Oh wait, the answer is always it depends
We need the answer
Anyone take a psychology class?
That might be some negligent parenting

You can think about it for a few more years
Whats your life long dream
have you had pandan waffles
I hate fries lol
I prefer regular fries
Fries
Chris what's your favorite meal
What word isnt improved by waffle
Mmmf
Yoo waffle burgers are soo good tho

Ihow
B
wait that's not waffles
ihob
I wanna eat a waffle
Declare yours right now
But the potential of the dream was always there
And it's just formulating fully at that point

It probably is
Or at least think it could be

He built the boat
Thatch?
So yeah I could see you or Chris
Did he wash up on their boat

this is everything you need to know about Franky
Wait is Chris like Franky theyre both ripped
Im the boat
I kind of like Thao as Chopper
Also always been a Sanji fan
I didnt get up to Franky in One Piece but I like his design
Also I meant Long Island
Neither would zoro
But i knew we were separated by bridges and water
I wouldn't use the word archipelago
Like how long has it taken you to realize youre on an archipelago right now
It would probably take more people a while to realize theres more islands than the one theyre on
If zoro was on a bunch of islands it would probably take him a while to realize there was more than one
Also I could probably take 1/4 of a persons pain at best
Which I would contest because thats not really the same as directions
I was
Or lack thereof
I thought he was saying I was zoro because of my geological knowledge
No question
I'm a luffy
andy did you say that so you could be zoro
Julian might be Sanji or Franky
Id say Im Brooke because hes a troll from 100 years ago
But i guess that means you'll get a perona
Someone is a zoro

Oh wait I guess it is just 1

So frickin good

Good episodes
But they only set it up at the end

I had the first 2 episodes on vhs
How do they teleport
The station is called the watchtower
And read some comics
Yeah i watched the justice league show
And theyre on shifts
They set up a blockade against alien attacks
Really?
They can teleport to earth instantly
Like the avengers are already there
How much benefit did it provide at the cost of presumably drastically lengthened response times to terrestrial incidents
Was it really efficient for the justice league to live in space
but I wouldn't be the kool aid man
I could do that
to me he could be filled with plum juice but as long as he breaks a wall and says aww yea and he's a pitcher then it's the kool aid man
And I thin kthe kool aid is more important to kool aid man's identity because if you put kool-aid in any other container and anthropomorphized it it could conceivably be kool-aid man but as soon as you replace the liquid then the validity of it being kool-aid man is way more suspect
actually that's true
There's no way of knowing that the voice isn't coming from the kool aid
cause the pitcher is solid and has a deep voice
and I don't know why the juice could or couldn't break the wall any more than the pitcher could
I feel like it wouldn't be right if the kool aid man could be full of orange juice but at the original question presents two suboptimal answers to begin with
the juice can't break the wall so he must be the pitcher
but then you could fill him up with something else
Kool Aid man is totally the pitcher
Asking are we skin or internal organs is like asking if money is the cotton paper printed with pictures of dead ppl
we and I as a concept is a human construct
are we skin or are we internal organs
[]NotEvenJohn   4617 points 9 hours ago  Is the Kool-Aid man the pitcher or the Kool-Aid inside the pitcher?
If you build up like a solid block but leave a space in the middle did you make a hole

Yeah but if he was split in exactly a half then neither side can claim ownship
Regenerators automatically regenerate
He's pretty much immortal
Wolverine has regenerated like his whole body before btw
His choice
That could survive it
But take another hypothetical regenerator then
But he wasnt split in half by the nuke
Idk he survived getting nuked
I think he just dies
If you cut wolverine in half vertically, what side would regenerate
Ahh the argonaut
The fun one is that one thats like  if you replace all the parts of a ship is it the same ship
Probably not
Talk about shit like is water wet
Wait so what do I say
I think I saw FE once and thought this was the fire emblem chat and never checked it again
This is its sole purpose
It was always 
Like originally

What chat is this
Wait a second
american propensity for the military :(
I feel like maybe it escalates like Call of Duty was cashing in on American military practices which in turn got some kids playing the game interested in the military
I mean same its the only genre of games Im bad at lol
but that's cause im a sjw that doesn't play shooters
my first instinct is to connect this to american masculinity being related to violence and power kind of and how those are relates to guns????
/would shooting games be more popular in Japan if more people there owned guns
How much of a correlation is there between the popularity of shooting games in the US and the USs love for guns relative to other countries
Which makes sense because theyre not Pokmon
like the divine beasts gluttony or something
I like the Ultra Beasts because they invoke the gen 1 weirdness a little bit
like pokemon is moving in such a weird direction
the super beasts or whatever theyre called tho
A monstrosity
oh my god what is magmar
If Magmar was created now it would look totally different
"what if that thing had eyes and a mouth"
Gen 1 Pokmon were sometimes based on a mash of things
I meant more like things are based on a tangible and very obvious thing
Thats true
Like we got literal trash recently
Like what the hell is the Nidoking line supposed to be
Idk about that
More recent gens are almost always based on animals or mythological basis but gen 1 was a little more loosey goosey and just threw in whatever they felt like
cause like the only animals are pokemon
do people eat pokemon meat in the pokemon world
Remember when real animals existed
the more i think about geodude, the more i love him
Not that I dont like the designs but they hadnt figured out a method yet
geodude
I feel like gen 1 Pokmon design was whatever throw it in there
Imagine being the guy who proposed the psychic eggs Pokmon
None of them are tied down here so I trust the psychic eggs to get out of the way
Okay but whos going to save Eggsecute over one togepi

Is being at your keyboard the irl version of being afk

im trying to think of a single time where i won a game
Havent lost once so fight me
Theres a chess cafe south of Washington Square Park you can play outside for like $5 Ive done it a few times
Allen challenges you to play chess! The first move was e4.
Allen set his own nickname to Brain food for your body.
Generation GT
Were on Generation Z now so something has to happen
like the guy that thought of "millenials"?
I wonder what it feels like to successfully name a generation
maybe
Isnt that deflation
in the future where a million dollars inflates into a lot
what if you could use the money to invent a machine that makes you mario utaunt
i would definitely take utaunt
I feel like I might just take the money
So you dont get stuck in it in the middle of the street
It might be better if you get hit out of it more easily
you could hone your focus to never be stunned and never get hit out of it
only if it deals hitstun
Should getting hit cancel it
Yeah
does it make the sound
literally just mario utaunt
Or move while doing it
You cant maintain it
So you couldn't maintain it or train it?
you need a mask and a secret identity
But if you have decent performance skills I guess then it could work
Plus I kind of doubt how much money you could really make purely off of utaunting
villain mario :O
You wouldn't be a hero
Nah
But in real life youd be the best superhero if you could like turn orange
Also since they exist with each other people dont care about the lamer ones
Movie superheroes live in movies
What if something entered you while you were "phasing"
but movie superheroes live normal lives and really youd just be a shitty xman
Just by the nature of the growth
Mario uptaunting would probably kill you
I feel like you could never have a normal life again
i feel like the ability to mario utaunt irl would net me $1 million in like performances or something\
Would you rather have $1 million or be able to Mario utaunt whenever you want
Or is it more accurate to evaluate based on an arbitrary threshold of sufficient sound distinction
do you have to write it yourself
Is the distinction in your intent
What determines whether youre singing your own song or covering it
Before legendary banners seasonal heroes were truly seasonal since you could only expect to summon them in their corresponding seasons but now that they can appear whenever legendary heroes do the line between them is blurred
but like real life seasons
They created elemental seasons
and they could
the real direct approach is "do big heroes have season"
do seasonal heroes need to come in groups
But legion fits that
You could say the definition is someone who isnt consistently summonable who has a paralogue but the first part is by far the main part anyway
but she's also in the main pool of heroes
Like Eirika has a paralogue
Its also a really indirect approach
That doesnt preclude Vanguard Ike from being seasonal
either way, seasonal heroes have paralogue that are not xenologues
Which is that its a story chapter that isnt part of the main story
It also fits the vague definition of paralogue as established by FE
It wouldnt make any sense for it to increase the number if it wasnt called a paralogue but the fact that its in paralogues suggests its a different type of paralogue
if it was then it'd increase the paralogue number by 1
it's also literally not called a paralogue
Its the only source material so if you say its wrong then nothing is valid anymore
but is that a definition or a misleading ui
Xenologues are in paralogues
also it's a xenologue and not a paralogue
id say no cause then he'd have a paralogue
But it wouldnt be right to say hes seasonal but the other legendary heroes arent
Id say so which means Vanguard Ike has a paralogue
Are xenologues paralogues
kind of
he had a paralogue
is veronica not a hero but will become a hero even though she did nothing
Is NY Corrin seasonal
Does the arbitrary syntax of Heroes cheapen the meaning of true heroism or does the breadth of its definitions including even the likes of Grima suggest that anyone can become a hero
but every seasonal hero has a paralogue and no big hero has a paralogue
What does it even mean to be a hero at all
Some regular heroes have paralogues
do you need a story paralogue to be seasonal
Well thats different because fat chance is just sarcastic
Slim chance fat chance
if youre up for something then youre down for it 
Are seasonal heroes brave 
actually thats true
Brave heroes are on every banner
are brave heroes seasonal
Are legendary heroes seasonal
im such a fan of this chat pic

neither is .00001 K of change
like, a billion and two billion K isnt a meaning distinction to us
or the scale is extreme enough
it stops making a difference to us perceptually when the numbers are extreme enough
perceptually yes
It scientifically gets warmer but its just as not hot as the lower temperature
sure
Thats why Im saying you wouldnt say it gets hotter
I mean, at the scale of -1000
actually, hot is almost purely a colloquial term
celsius has negative temps but ok what about -272 to -271
warm and hot mean the same thing in TD
It depends purely on how youre defining hot or cold at the moment
negative temps implies youre not using Celsius or Kelvin
It becomes warmer but not hotter
so it works for really low temps but not really high temps???
That is, under most metrics of temp
but if you increase from -1000 to -999, then it increases thermodynamically but not physiologically
its equally as inhospitable
so that means its not colder thermodynamically or physiologically
if youre talking colloquially, then nope it doesnt make a difference
in TD theres no such thing as cold
because philosophy is a democracy
thermodynamically?
im voting yes
Objectively
Yes
If the temperature increases from 1000 to 1001 did it become less cold
but thats cause metal has a higher specific heat so more of your heat is lost
Julius answer this
even tho theres usually no temp difference
Touching metal makes you feel colder than touching wood
this discussion could be much more organized if we outline what were talking from
what if captain cold makes you feel cold but doesnt decrease the temperature
Were mixing up physical temperature and our physiological perception of and response to temperatures relative to thermal conductivity and our body temperature
captain cold was wrong
is cold real
is anything cold
Cold doesnt exist
like if heat goes down then cold goes up
i dont mean like 0 heat
If youre going by that definition then the heat is there
but cold is like actually literally defined as the absence of heat
But at high numbers of people, going down one number isnt going to make it more unoccupied
You could define unoccupied as the absence of people
but isnt cold defined as the absence of heat
Yeah
If youre closer to death are you farther from life
Why not
The reason I started with this is because I said less hot isnt the same as more cold
Yeah
if 99 degrees is less hot than 100 then does that necessarily make it true that 99 is more cold
Well realistically I would also say its easier to get to 2019 but I think the other way of looking at it is interesting
I think the coldness of high temperatures is the same thing
Most people would naturally say 2019 is easier because its closer but ease and proximity are actually separate
Its not like even death would stop you from advancing in time
Theres nothing you could really do that would make either time easier or harder
Like consider whether its easier to get to 2019 or 2020
I think it is and a lot of things are similar unless you conflate distance to the borderline with the intensity of the quality
now im thinking is negativeness actually binary
maybe its always relevant cause you can always synthesize a relevant thing
triethylborane lights on fire at -4 degrees
The question is whether or not the comparisons hold when youre beyond the range where its relevant
Even if it was possible for something to get burned at 1 degree which would require like a 1 degree fire it doesnt really matter because you can consider a lower temperature example
what if something gets burned at 1 degree but not 0
Scorching is just if something gets burned
but something could scorch at 1 degree but not 0
-1 isnt less negative than -2
what if something scorches at 1 degree like a scorch point
Theres a disparity in the temperature but not in the amount of scorching or hotness because you have to pass a certain threshold before some qualities can exist at all
what if something had its boiling point at 1 degree
its like 0 and 0.000001
So they would be the same amount of scorching
its more
Neither is scorching at all
but it is more scorching
Im all hotness
Like it could be warmer for sure but to say its hotter is the same as saying 1 degree is more scorching than 0 degrees which is only accurate in the sense that youre comparing negative quantities
if theres hotness then theres always coldness to compare cause cold is the absence of heat
The Andy Bow Effect changed the group photo.
theres always coldness to compare
And similarly it could be wrong to say that 1 degree is hotter than 0 degrees
My friend said you can because its objectively colder but I feel like its debatable because you could reasonably argue that beyond a certain temperature there is no longer any coldness to compare
Sometimes I would feel better about getting a B+ than an A-
Today I was wondering about whether you can say that 99 degrees is colder than 100 degrees
